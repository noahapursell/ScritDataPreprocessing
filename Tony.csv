Tony," I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!"
Soldier," We can talk, sir."
Tony," Oh, I see. So it's personal?"
Tony," Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."
Tony," Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? [The Soldiers in the vehicle laugh and chuckle.] Come on, it's okay, laugh."
Soldier," Sir, I have a question to ask."
Tony," Yes, please."
Soldier, Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
Tony," That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? [The Soldier next to him, Jimmy, raises his hand.] You're kidding me with the hand up, right?"
Tony," Yes. It's very cool. [The soldier next to him pulls his camera out and hands it to the soldier in the front seat.] I don't want to see this on your MySpace page. [The Soldier puts up a peace sign for the photo.] Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace."
Tony, What's going on?
Tony, What have we got?
Soldier," Jimmy, stay with Stark!"
Tony, Yeah.
Tony," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!"
 He looked over to see it say," Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn't in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]"
Tony, Whoa!
Voice over," Tony. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe."
James Rhodes," As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony. Tony?"
Obadiah Stane," Thank you, Colonel."
James Rhodes, Thanks for the save.
Obadiah Stane," This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working."
Tony, Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
James Rhodes, You are unbelievable.
Tony," Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?"
James Rhodes, Nobody roped me into anything!
Tony, I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes," But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored."
Tony," Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?"
James Rhodes, It's right here. Here you go.
Tony, There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes," Yeah, it's okay."
Tony," Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. [hot girl blows on dice] Okay, you, too. [Tony holds the dice out to Rhodes.]"
James Rhodes, I don't blow on a man's dice.
Tony," Come on, honey bear."
James Rhodes, I don't blow on a man's dice. [Rhodes knocks Tony's hand away causing the dice to roll]
Tony, There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Dealer, Two craps. Line away.
James Rhodes, That's what happens.
Tony," Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?"
James Rhodes, This is where I exit.
Tony, All right.
James Rhodes," Tomorrow, don't be late."
Tony," Yeah, you can count on it."
James Rhodes, I'm serious!
Tony," I know, I know. [Handing over his award to Caesar.] Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go."
Christine Everhart," Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?"
Happy Hogan, [whispering to Tony] She's cute.
Tony, She's all right? [Turns to face Christine.] Hi.
Christine Everhart, Hi.
Tony, Yeah. Okay--
Christine Everhart, It's okay?
Tony, Go.
Christine Everhart, You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
Tony, Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
Christine Everhart," And what do you say to your other nickname? ""The Merchant of Death""?"
Tony, That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
Christine Everhart," Brown, actually."
Tony," Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals."
Christine Everhart, You rehearse that much?
Tony, Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
Christine Everhart, I can see that.
Tony, I'd like to show you first-hand.
Christine Everhart, All I want is a serious answer.
Tony," Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."""
Christine Everhart, That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
Tony," My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero."
Christine Everhart, And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
Tony," Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey."
Christine Everhart, You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
Tony, I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
JARVIS, Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
Christine Everhart," [Walking around Tony's mansion.] Tony? Hey, Tony? [Tries to play with the controls on the wall. It beeps at her.]"
JARVIS, You are not authorized to access this area.
Christine Everhart, Jesus.
Pepper Potts," That's JARVIS. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go."
Christine Everhart, You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
Pepper Potts, Indeed I am.
Christine Everhart," After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning."
Pepper Potts," I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?"
Tony, Give me an exploded view.
JARVIS, The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
Tony, Log that.
Pepper Potts," [Coming in on her phone.] I'm gonna try again, right now."
Tony, Please don't turn down my music.
Pepper Potts, I'll keep you posted. [Getting off the phone.] You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
Tony, How'd she take it?
Pepper Potts, Like a champ.
Tony, Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Pepper Potts, Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
Tony," That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there."
Pepper Potts," Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door."
Tony," I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?"
Pepper Potts, Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.
Tony, Is it a good representation of his spring period?
Pepper Potts," Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked--"
Tony, So?
Pepper Potts," --not ""spring"" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced."
Tony, I need it. Buy it. Store it.
Pepper Potts, Okay. The MIT commencement speech...
Tony," Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down..."
Pepper Potts," Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes."
Tony, Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
Pepper Potts, I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
Tony," What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?"
Pepper Potts," As a matter of fact, I do."
Tony, I don't like it when you have plans.
Pepper Potts, I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
Tony, It's your birthday?
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Tony, I knew that. Already?
Pepper Potts, Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
Tony," Well, get yourself something nice from me."
Pepper Potts, I already did.
Tony, And?
Pepper Potts," Oh, it was very nice."
Tony, Yeah.
Pepper Potts," Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark."
Tony," You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay."
Tony, You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
Happy," You did, sir. [Grabbing Tony's things from the trunk.] I had to cut across Mulholland."
Tony, I got you. I got you.
James Rhodes, What's wrong with you? [Standing at the jet doorway.]
Tony, What?
James Rhodes, Three hours.
Tony, I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
James Rhodes, For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
Tony, Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!
Tony," What you reading, platypus?"
James Rhodes, Nothing.
Tony," Come on, sour patch."
James Rhodes, I'm not sour.
Tony, Don't be mad.
James Rhodes," I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?"
Tony, I said I was sorry.
James Rhodes, You don't need to apologize to me.
Tony, I told you I was sorry.
James Rhodes, I'm your man.
Tony," Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he..."
James Rhodes, I'm just indifferent right now.
James Rhodes," You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me."
Tony, I respect you.
James Rhodes," I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... [grabs a hot towel] Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?"
Tony," Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me."
James Rhodes," No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now."
Tony, You can't have sashimi without sake.
James Rhodes, You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
Tony, It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
Tony," Yes, two, please."
James Rhodes, No. Just-- I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
James Rhodes," That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!"
Tony," Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out..."
James Rhodes," No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are."
Tony, Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
James Rhodes, No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!
Tony, General.
General," Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation."
Tony, Thanks.
Tony," Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. [The missiles get launched.] For your consideration, the Jericho. [The missiles explode]"
Tony, [Opening a cooler full of alcohol]I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! [Tony's phone begins ringing.]
Obadiah Stane, [through the video chat] Tony.
Tony," Obie, what are you doing up?"
Obadiah Stane, I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
Tony, It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Obadiah Stane," Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?"
Tony, Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Obadiah Stane," Good night, Tony. [Tony hangs up the call as he enters the military vehicle.]"
James Rhodes," Hey, Tony. [Coming up to the vehicle Tony's in.]"
Tony," I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there."
James Rhodes, Nice job.
Tony, See you back at base.
Yinsen, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tony, What the hell did you do to me?
Yinsen," What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? [Pulls out a bottle of shrapnel.] I have a souvenir. Take a look. [Tosses the bottle to Tony] I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs."
Tony, What is this?
Yinsen," That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm? [Tony sips up the jacket he's wearing and looks at the camera on the ceiling.] That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern."
Tony, I don't remember.
Yinsen," No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits."
Tony, Where are we?
Yinsen," Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up."
Tony, Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
Yinsen," Do you understand me? Do as I do. [A man starts speaking in Arabic. Yinsen translates for him.] He says, ""Welcome, Tony, the most famous mass murderer ""in the history of America."" [Man speaks in Arabic.] He is honored. [Man speaks in Arabic.] He wants you to build the missile. [Man speaks in Arabic.] The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. [Man speaks in Arabic, handing Yinsen a picture of the Jericho missile.] This one."
Tony, I refuse. [Tony then is shown with his head in a large thing of water. Flashes of himself and the electromagnet in his chest are shown.]
Pepper Potts, Tony! [As a voice in his head as he tries not to drown.]
Yinsen, He wants to know what you think.
Tony, I think you got a lot of my weapons.
Yinsen," He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. [Man speaks Arabic again] He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free."
Tony," No, he won't. [Shaking the Arabic man's hand.]"
Yinsen," No, he won't."
Yinsen," [Tony sitting around a small fire in the cave with Tony] I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony? Or are you going to do something about it?"
Tony," Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week."
Yinsen," Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?"
Tony," [Directing the men to where to put things while Yinsen's translating] If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. [Yinsen and Tony start taking apart the weapons.] How many languages do you speak?"
Yinsen," A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian."
Tony, Who are these people?
Yinsen," They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. [The men of the Ten Rings are shown watching Tony and Yinsen work on a TV.] You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process."
Tony," Uh-huh. [Tony pulls apart a missile.] Okay, we don't need this."
Yinsen, What is that?
Tony," That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?"
Tony," Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this."
Yinsen, Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?
Tony, What do I call you?
Yinsen, My name is Yinsen.
Tony, Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
Yinsen," Nice to meet you, too. [Tony puts together a device while Yinsen watches.] Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile."
Tony, That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
Yinsen, But what could it generate?
Tony," If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second."
Yinsen, That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
Tony, Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
Tony, [Looking at sheets of paper with Tony] This is our ticket out of here.
Yinsen, What is it?
Tony, Flatten them out and look. [Yinsen flattens the sheets out to see a drawing of a metal suit.]
Yinsen," Oh, wow. Impressive."
Yinsen, Good. Good roll. Good roll.
Tony, You still haven't told me where you're from.
Yinsen, I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place.
Tony, Got a family?
Yinsen," Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?"
Tony, No.
Yinsen, No? So you're a man who has everything and nothing.
Raza," Relax. [Motioning for the two men to remove their hands from above their heads. They do so as Raza comes up and inspects Tony's arc reactor.] The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn. [Starts speaking in Urdu as he stares down Tony.] Why have you failed me?"
Yinsen, We're working. Diligently. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza, [Turns and walks toward Yinsen.] I let you live. This is how you repay me? [Speaking in Urdu.]
Yinsen, It's very complex. He's trying very hard. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza, On his knees. [He commands his men in Urdu. Yinsen is forced to his knees.] You think I'm a fool? I'll get the truth. [Speaking in Urdu as he takes a coal from the dying fire.]
Yinsen, We're both working. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Raza, Open your mouth. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Tony, What does he want?
Raza, You think I'm a fool? What's going on? Tell me the truth. [Speaking in Urdu. Raza forces Yinsen's head to lay on the table.]
Yinsen, He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho. [Speaking in Urdu.]
Tony, What do you want? A delivery date? [Tony tries to go towards Raza and Yinsen but the other men pull their guns on him.] I need him. Good assistant.
Raza, You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
Yinsen," Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again."
Tony," 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right."
Raza, Where is Stark? [Speaking Arabic]
Man, He was here a moment ago. [Speaking Arabic]
Raza, Go look for him. [Speaking Arabic]
Man, Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!
Tony, Say something. Say something back to him.
Yinsen, He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
Tony, Then speak Hungarian.
Yinsen, Okay. I know.
Tony, What do you know?
Tony, How'd that work?
Yinsen," Oh, my goodness. It worked all right."
Tony, That's what I do.
Yinsen, Let me finish this.
Tony, Initialize the power sequence.
Yinsen, Okay.
Tony, Now!
Yinsen, Tell me. Tell me.
Tony, Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
Yinsen, Yes.
Tony, Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
Yinsen, I have it.
Tony," Press Control ""l""."
Yinsen," ""I."""
Tony," ""I."" ""Enter."""
Yinsen, Got it.
Tony," ""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up."
Yinsen, Okay. All right.
Tony, Every other hex bolt.
Yinsen, They're coming!
Tony," Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done."
Yinsen, They're coming.
Tony," Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?"
Yinsen," We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time."
Tony, Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! [Yinsen runs out of the cave with a gun from one of the dead men.] Yinsen! Yinsen!
Tony, Yinsen!
Yinsen," Watch out! [Raza tries to shoot at Tony but misses. Tony shoots back, hitting the wall behind Raza, causing a mini explosion and knocking Raza out.] Stark."
Tony," Come on. [Tony opens is helmet.] We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it."
Yinsen," This was always the plan, Stark."
Tony," Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up."
Yinsen," My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this."
Tony, Thank you for saving me.
Yinsen, Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
Tony," My turn. [Tony shoots fire at the men and their camp from his suit. The men continue to shoot at Tony, beginning to cause damage to the suit. Tony flips a suit and shoots up in the air. He screams as he falls into the sand on the other side of the mountains. The suit breaks when he lands.] Not bad."
Tony, Hey! [Waving down the helicopters.] Hey!
James Rhodes," How was the ""fun-vee""? Next time, you ride with me, okay?"
James Rhodes," Watch it, coming up here."
Tony, Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. [Tony walks up to Pepper.] Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
Pepper Potts, Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Tony," Yeah, vacation's over."
Happy," Where to, sir?"
Pepper Potts," Take us to the hospital, please, Happy."
Tony, No.
Pepper Potts," No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital."
Tony, No is a complete answer.
Pepper Potts, The doctor has to look at you.
Tony," I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other..."
Pepper Potts, That's enough of that.
Tony, ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
Pepper Potts, Call for a press conference?
Tony, Yeah.
Pepper Potts, What on earth for?
Tony," Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first."
Obadiah Stane, Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.
Tony," No, I'm fine."
Obadiah Stane," Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?"
Tony," Well, come on."
Obadiah Stane, You get me one of those?
Tony, There's only one left. I need it.
Obadiah Stane," Hey, look who's here! Yeah!"
Agent Coulson, Miss Potts?
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Agent Coulson, Can I speak to you for a moment?
Pepper Potts," I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now."
Agent Coulson," I'm not a reporter. I'm Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."
Pepper Potts, That's quite a mouthful.
Agent Coulson, I know. We're working on it.
Pepper Potts," You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA..."
Agent Coulson, We're a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
Pepper Potts," I'll put something in the book, shall I?"
Agent Coulson, Thank you.
Obadiah Stane," Well, let's get this started, uh..."
Tony," Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? [Sitting in front of the podium.] Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... [Tony takes a bite of his cheeseburger as everyone sits, or squats, down]"
James Rhodes, What's up with the love-in?
Pepper Potts, Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to.
Tony, Good to see you.
Obadiah Stane, Good to see you.
Tony," I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability."
Reporters, Mr. Stark!
Tony," Hey, Ben."
Tony," I had my eyes opened. [Tony stands and moves behind the podium.] I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International [Everyone stands up in commotion.] until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be."
Obadiah Stane, I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. [Standing up beside Tony.]
Tony," What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. [Tony leaves the stage.]"
Obadiah Stane," What we should take away from this is that Tony's back! And he's healthier than ever. We're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up. [Obadiah is shown on a Segway, riding up to one of the Stark buildings. Happy leaning against a car outside.] Where is he?"
Happy, He's inside.
Obadiah Stane," Well, that..uh... That went well."
Tony, Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
Obadiah Stane, Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
Tony," Uh, optimistically, 40 points."
Obadiah Stane, At minimum.
Tony, Yep.
Obadiah Stane," Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer."
Tony," Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy."
Obadiah Stane, That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
Tony, It's my name on the side of the building.
Obadiah Stane, And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
Tony, Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
Obadiah Stane, Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
Tony, I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
Obadiah Stane," Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up."
Tony, It works.
Obadiah Stane," Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?"
Tony, Maybe.
Obadiah Stane, Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.
Tony," That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?"
Obadiah Stane, Never mind who told me. Show me.
Tony, It's Rhodey or Pepper.
Obadiah Stane, I want to see it.
Tony," Okay, Rhodey. [Tony opens his shirt to show Obadiah the reactor in his chest.]"
Obadiah Stane, Okay. [Obadiah begins to button Tony's shirt back up.]
Tony, Okay? It works.
Obadiah Stane," Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I."
Tony," I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had..."
Obadiah Stane," Tony. Tony, no more of this ""ready, fire, aim"" business. You understand me?"
Tony, That was Dad's line.
Obadiah Stane, You gotta let me handle this. We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We're going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
Newcaster," Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!"
Tony, [Over the intercoms] Pepper. How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts, What?
Tony, How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts, I don't understand why...
Tony," Get down here. I need you. [Pepper enters Tony's workshop to find Tony lying shirtless on a chair.] Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them. [Pepper holds up her hands as she comes closer.] Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec."
Pepper Potts," Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?"
Tony," It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump."
Pepper Potts," Speed bump, what does that mean?"
Tony," It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine. [Tony pulls out the old device, handing it to Pepper.]"
Pepper Potts, What do you want me to do?
Tony, Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
Pepper Potts," Oh, my God! [Setting the old reactor on the table.]"
Tony," I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out."
Pepper Potts, Is it safe?
Tony," Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep."""
Pepper Potts," What do you mean, ""Operation""?"
Tony," It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire."
Pepper Potts, Okay.
Tony, Okay? Great.
Pepper Potts," You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this."
Tony," No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm..."
Pepper Potts," Okay, okay."
Tony, I really need your help here.
Pepper Potts," Okay. [Slides her hand into the hole in Tony's chest.] Oh, there's pus!"
Tony," It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body."
Pepper Potts, It smells!
Tony," Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?"
Pepper Potts," Okay, I got it! I got it!"
Tony," Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch [Pepper lets it touch the side.] the sides when you're coming out!"
Pepper Potts, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tony," That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't... [Pepper pulls out the wire with the magnet attached and the medical equipment starts beeping.] There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out."
Pepper Potts," Oh, God!"
Tony," Okay, I was not expecting..."
Pepper Potts," Okay, what do I do?"
Tony, Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
Pepper Potts, What's wrong?
Tony," Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--"
Pepper Potts, What? You said it was safe!
Tony, 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
Pepper Potts, Okay. Okay. Tony?
Tony, What?
Pepper Potts, It's going to be okay. Okay?
Tony, Is it?
Pepper Potts, It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.
Tony," Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... [Screams went it attaches.] Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice."
Pepper Potts, Are you okay?
Tony," Yeah, I feel great. You okay?"
Pepper Potts," Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again."
Tony, I don't have anyone but you. Anyway... [Tony rips on the wires off and stands up.]
Pepper Potts, What do you want me to do with this? [Holding Tony's old reactor.]
Tony, That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
Pepper Potts, You don't want to keep it?
Tony," Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them."
Pepper Potts," Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
Tony," That will be all, Miss Potts. [Turns to talk to his robot while he eyes Pepper as she walks away.] Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff."
James Rhodes," The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment."
Tony, Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
James Rhodes, Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony.
Man," Hello, sir."
Tony," Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with."
James Rhodes, Don't do that!
Tony, What was his name?
James Rhodes, Don't do that.
Tony, Was it Ivan?
James Rhodes, Don't do that. They'll believe it.
Tony, Okay.
James Rhodes, Don't do that.
Tony, Okay.
James Rhodes, Don't do that.
Tony, Pleasure meeting you.
James Rhodes," Give us a couple minutes, you guys. [The group walks off.] I'm surprised."
Tony, Why?
James Rhodes," I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon."
Tony, I'm doing a little better than walking.
James Rhodes, Really?
Tony," Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it."
James Rhodes," You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy."
Tony, This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
James Rhodes, What? You're a humanitarian now or something?
Tony, I need you to listen to me.
James Rhodes, No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious.
Tony, Okay.
James Rhodes," It's nice seeing you, Tony. [Rhodey walks off.]"
Tony, Thanks.
Tony," JARVIS, you up?"
JARVIS," For you, sir, always."
Tony," I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two."
JARVIS, Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
Tony," Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?"
JARVIS," Working on a secret project, are we, sir?"
Tony," I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."
Tony," Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy."
Tony," Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one."
Tony," Up two. All right, set that."
Pepper Potts, I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Tony," Yeah, everything's... What? [Still distracted with the flight stabilizer.]"
Pepper Potts, Obadiah's upstairs.
Tony, Great!
Pepper Potts, What would you like me to tell him?
Tony, Great. I'll be right up.
Pepper Potts, Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.
Tony," It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless. [The stabilizer shoots, flinging Tony backwards and scaring Pepper.] I didn't expect that. [Tony then comes up stairs to find Obadiah playing the piano and Pepper working on the couch.] How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?"
Obadiah Stane, Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad. [Still playing the piano.]
Tony," Sure doesn't. Oh, boy."
Obadiah Stane, It would have gone better if you were there.
Tony," Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all..."
Obadiah Stane," Hey, come on. In public. The press. [Comes over to sit next to Tony.] This was a board of directors meeting."
Tony, This was a board of directors meeting?
Obadiah Stane, The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction.
Tony, A what?
Obadiah Stane, They want to lock you out.
Tony," Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen."
Pepper Potts, Fifty-six and a half.
Tony, It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
Obadiah Stane," Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest."
Tony," I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. [Tony stands up, taking the pizza box with him. Obadiah follows.]"
Obadiah Stane," Oh, come on. Tony. Tony."
Tony, I'll be in the shop.
Obadiah Stane," Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs."
Tony," No. No, absolutely not."
Obadiah Stane, It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!
Tony," This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it."
Obadiah Stane," All right, well, this stays with me, then. [Obadiah takes the pizza box back.] Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two."
Tony, Thank you.
Obadiah Stane, You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
Tony," Good night, Obie. [Tony heads back down to his workshop]"
Tony," [running another flight test, this time wearing the boots and hand flight stabilizers] Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground and hovers for a bit before landing.] Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one. [Lifts off the ground with less control and starts hovering all over the workshop.] Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay. [Lands where he started. Dummy goes to use the fire extinguisher.] No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly."
Tony," JARVIS, are you there?"
JARVIS," At your service, sir."
Tony, Engage heads-up display.
JARVIS, Check.
Tony, Import all preferences from home interface.
JARVIS," Will do, sir."
Tony," All right, what do you say?"
JARVIS," I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready."
Tony, Can we start the virtual walk-around?
JARVIS, Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
Tony, Do a check on control surfaces
JARVIS, As you wish. [The full suit is shown.] Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
Tony," Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control."
JARVIS," Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is..."
Tony," JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one. [Begins hovering and flies out of the garage into the sky.] Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?"
JARVIS," The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir."
Tony, Records are made to be broken! Come on! [Begins flying straight up.]
JARVIS," Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring."
Tony," Keep going! Higher! [Ice builds up around the suit, causing it to stop working and him to start flying from the sky.] We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!"
Tony, Kill power.
Tony, Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
JARVIS," A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems."
Tony, Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
JARVIS, Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Tony, Thrill me.
TV Reporter," Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society."
Tony," JARVIS, we get an invite for that?"
JARVIS," I have no record of an invitation, sir."
TV Reporter," ... hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight."
JARVIS, The render is complete.
Tony," A little ostentatious, don't you think?"
JARVIS, What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tony, Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
JARVIS," Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete."
Tony," Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it."
JARVIS, Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Tony," Don't wait up for me, honey."
Obadiah Stane," Weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community..."
Random Woman," Hey, Tony, remember me?"
Tony," Sure don't. You look great, Hef."
Obadiah Stane, We're going to have a great quarter.
Tony, What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
Obadiah Stane," Look at you. Hey, what a surprise."
Tony, I'll see you inside.
Obadiah Stane," Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them"
Tony, You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
Agent Coulson, Mr. Stark?
Tony, Yeah?
Agent Coulson, Agent Coulson.
Tony," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the.."
Agent Coulson," Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."
Tony," God, you need a new name for that."
Agent Coulson," Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things."
Tony, Let's just put something on the books.
Agent Coulson, How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?
Tony," Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you."
Pepper Potts, What are you doing here?
Tony, Just avoiding government agents.
Pepper Potts, Are you by yourself?
Tony, Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
Pepper Potts," Oh, it was a birthday present."
Tony, That's great.
Pepper Potts," From you, actually."
Tony," Well, I got great taste."
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Tony, You want to dance?
Pepper Potts," Oh, no."
Tony," All right, come on."
Pepper Potts, Thank you. No.
Tony, Am I making you uncomfortable?
Pepper Potts, No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.
Tony, You look great and you smell great.
Pepper Potts," Oh, God."
Tony, But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
Pepper Potts, I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.
Tony, I'd make it a week. Sure.
Pepper Potts, Really? What's your Social Security number?
Tony, Five.
Pepper Potts, Five?
Tony, Right.
Pepper Potts, Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.
Tony," The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?"
Pepper Potts," Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird."
Tony, Totally harmless.
Pepper Potts," It was totally not harmless, by the way."
Tony, We're dancing. No one's even watching.
Pepper Potts," Everybody who I work with... No, you know why?"
Tony, I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
Pepper Potts," No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you."
Tony, I don't think it was taken that way.
Pepper Potts, Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...
Tony, I just think you're overstating it.
Pepper Potts," You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please."
Tony," Got it, okay."
Pepper Potts," I would like a vodka martini, please."
Tony, Okay.
Pepper Potts," Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives."
Tony," Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?"
Christine Everhart, Wow. Tony.
Tony," Oh, hey."
Christine Everhart, Fancy seeing you here.
Tony, Carrie.
Christine Everhart, Christine.
Tony, Carrie.
Christine Everhart, Christine.
Tony, That's right.
Christine Everhart, You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Tony, Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
Christine Everhart, 'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity
Tony, Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
Christine Everhart," I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker."
Tony," I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear."
Christine Everhart, Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?
Tony, When were these taken?
Christine Everhart, Yesterday.
Tony, I didn't approve any shipment.
Christine Everhart," Well, your company did."
Tony," Well, I'm not my company."
Obadiah Stane," Please, do you mind?"
Tony, Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
Obadiah Stane," Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive."
Tony," You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?"
Reporter," Tony, your picture, please!"
Obadiah Stane, Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.
Obadiah Stane, No. No.
TV Reporter," The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, ""Where are my mother and father?"" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help."
Tony, He's all yours.
Captain, What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?
Major Allen, Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
Major Allen, We got the CIA on the line?
Captain, I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.
Major Allen, I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?
Major Allen, Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!
Major Allen, We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.
James Rhodes, Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?
Captain, We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.
James Rhodes," So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn't show up on the radar?"
James Rhodes, Is it stealth?
Major Allen," Colonel, what are we dealing with here?"
James Rhodes, Let me make a call.
Major Allen," Sergeant, clear a hole."
Tony, Hello?
James Rhodes, Tony?
Tony, Who's this?
James Rhodes, It's Rhodes.
Tony," Sorry, hello?"
James Rhodes, I said it's Rhodes.
Tony," Speak up, please."
James Rhodes, What in the hell is that noise?
Tony," Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down."
James Rhodes," Yeah, well, I need your help right now."
Tony," It's funny how that works, huh?"
James Rhodes," Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive."
Tony," Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?"
James Rhodes," Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?"
Tony," I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon."
James Rhodes, I thought you were driving.
Tony," Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog."
James Rhodes, You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
Tony, Nope!
James Rhodes," Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come."
Tony, That's my exit.
James Rhodes," Whiplash One, what is it?"
Major Allen, You have radio contact?
Major Allen, Then you are clear to engage.
Tony, Hit it.
JARVIS, Inbound missile.
Tony, Flares!
Tony, Deploy flaps!
Major Allen, What is it?
James Rhodes, Hello?
Tony," Hi, Rhodey, it's me."
James Rhodes, It's who?
Tony," I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me."
James Rhodes," No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?"
Tony, This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Major Allen," Rhodey, you got anything for me?"
Major Allen, Mark your position and return to base.
Major Allen," Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it."
James Rhodes," Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors."
Major Allen," That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!"
JARVIS, You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
James Rhodes," Tony, you still there?"
Tony," Hey, thanks."
James Rhodes," Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?"
Tony," Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?"
James Rhodes," No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?"
Tony, Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
James Rhodes," It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved."
Tony, Hey!
JARVIS," It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt."
Tony," Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to..."
JARVIS," Please, try not to move, sir."
Pepper Potts, What's going on here?
Tony, Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Pepper Potts, Are those bullet holes?
Raza, Welcome. Compliments of Tony.
Obadiah Stane," If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face."
Raza, You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.
Obadiah Stane, Show me the weapon.
Raza, Come. Leave your guards outside. [Raza and Stane walk inside the tent] His escape bore unexpected fruit.
Obadiah Stane, So this is how he did it.
Raza," This is only a first, crude effort. Stark has perfected his design. He has made a masterpiece of death. A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia. And you dream of Stark's throne. We have a common enemy. If we are still in business, I will give you these designs... as a gift. And in turn, I hope you'll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers."
Obadiah Stane," Technology. [Stane uses a machine to stun Raza] It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world. Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes. That's the least of your problems. [Stane walks out of the tent] Crate up the armor and the rest of it. All right, let's finish up here."
Obadiah Stane," [Talking in the phone while in a car] Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor, and I'm going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers. I want a prototype right away."
Tony," Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading."
Pepper Potts, And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?
Tony," Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them."
Pepper Potts," Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again."
Tony, There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
Pepper Potts," Is that so? Well, then, I quit. [Pepper throws the lock chip on the table.]"
Tony," You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?"
Pepper Potts," You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it."
Tony," I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."
Pepper Potts," [Pepper picks the lock drive back up.] You're all I have, too, you know. [In Stark's office, Pepper goes on a computer to use the drive.] Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah? [She finds a video of Stark held hostage and translates it.]"
Video Voice Over," You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony. As you can see, Obadiah Stane..."
Pepper Potts," Oh, my God."
Video Voice Over, ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony has just gone up.
Obadiah Stane," [Walks in on Pepper.] So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you're going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart."
Pepper Potts," Well, he's a complicated person. He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right."
Obadiah Stane, You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.
Pepper Potts," Thank you. Thanks. I'd better get back there. [Pulls the drive out, hiding it under a newspaper.]"
Obadiah Stane, Is that today's paper?
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Obadiah Stane, Do you mind?
Pepper Potts, Not at all.
Obadiah Stane, Puzzle.
Pepper Potts, Of course.
Obadiah Stane, Take care. [Goes on the computer and sees that the files have been downloaded.]
Agent Coulson, Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?
Pepper Potts," Nope, right now. Come with me."
Agent Coulson, Right now?
Pepper Potts," We're going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me."
Agent Coulson, Okay.
Pepper Potts, I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.
William," [On the phone.] Yeah, we've been working our best to do it. Absolutely, we're... I'm going to have to call you back. [Ends the call as Stane walks in] Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us, and it seems as though there's a little hiccup. Actually..."
Obadiah Stane, A hiccup?
William," Yes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. So, it's..."
Obadiah Stane," Wait, wait, wait. The technology? William, here is the technology. I've asked you to simply make it smaller."
William," Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying to do, but honestly, it's impossible."
Obadiah Stane, Tony was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
William," Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony."
Pepper Potts," [On the phone.] Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?"
Obadiah Stane," [Stuns Stark with the same machine as he did Raza.] Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It's a shame the government didn't approve it. There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that. [Pulls out the arc reactor from Starks chest.] You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could've seen my prototype. It's not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived."
James Rhodes," [On the phone.] What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where's Tony now?"
Pepper Potts," [On the phone.] I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut."
Tony, [Dummy hands Stark Pepper's gift] Good boy.
James Rhodes, Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?
Tony, Where's Pepper?
James Rhodes, She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah.
Tony, That's not going to be enough.
Pepper Potts," Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key's not working. It's not opening the door. Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device. It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?"
Agent Coulson, You might want to take a few steps back.
James Rhodes, That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Tony," Not bad, huh? Let's do it."
James Rhodes, You need me to do anything else?
Tony, Keep the skies clear.
James Rhodes," Damn! Next time, baby."
Agent Coulson, Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.
Pepper Potts, I thought it'd be bigger.
Tony, How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
JARVIS," The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight."
Tony, Keep me posted. Pepper!
Pepper Potts," Tony! Tony, are you okay?"
Tony, I'm fine. How are...
Pepper Potts," Obadiah, he's gone insane!"
Tony," I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there."
Pepper Potts, He built a suit.
Tony, Get out of there right now!
Obadiah Stane, Where do you think you're going? Your services are no longer required.
Tony, Stane!
Obadiah Stane, I love this suit!
Tony, Put them down!
Obadiah Stane," Collateral damage, Tony."
Tony, Divert power to chest RT.
Jarvis, Power reduced to 19%.
Tony," Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Obadiah Stane," For 30 years, I've been holding you up! I built this company from nothing! Nothing is going to stand in my way. Least of all... you! Impressive. You've upgraded your armor! I've made some upgrades of my own!"
JARVIS," Sir, it appears that his suit can fly."
Tony, Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
JARVIS," With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--"
Tony, I know the math! Do it!
James Rhodes," Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise."
JARVIS," Thirteen percent power, sir."
Tony, Climb!
JARVIS, Eleven percent.
Tony, Keep going!
JARVIS, Seven percent power.
Tony, Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!
Obadiah Stane," You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!"
Tony, How'd you solve the icing problem?
Obadiah Stane, Icing problem?
Tony, Might want to look into it.
JARVIS, Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.
Tony, Woah! Potts!
Pepper Potts," Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Tony, I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Obadiah Stane, Nice try!
Tony, Weapons status?
JARVIS, Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.
Tony, Flares!
Obadiah Stane," Very clever, Tony."
Tony, Potts?
Pepper Potts, Tony!
Tony, This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
Pepper Potts," Well, how are you going to do that?"
Tony," You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here."
Pepper Potts, Okay. I'm going in now.
Tony, Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important! [Pulls out a wire from Obadiah Stane's suit.]
Obadiah Stane," I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You'd have made your father proud!"
Pepper Potts," It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!"
Obadiah Stane," How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!"
Tony, Pepper!
Obadiah Stane, And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!
Tony, Time to hit the button!
Pepper Potts, You told me not to!
Obadiah Stane," Hold still, you little prick!"
Tony, Just do it!
Pepper Potts, You'll die!
Tony, Push it!
Pepper Potts, Tony!
James Rhodes," [On the TV] You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony's personal security staff..."
Tony," ""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway."
Agent Coulson, Here's your alibi.
Tony, Okay?
Agent Coulson, You were on your yacht.
Tony, Yeah.
Agent Coulson," We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests."
Tony," See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island."
Agent Coulson, That's what happened.
Tony, All right.
Agent Coulson," Just read it, word for word."
Tony, There's nothing about Stane here.
Agent Coulson, That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.
Tony," But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?"
Agent Coulson," This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you. You've got 90 seconds."
Pepper Potts, Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.
Agent Coulson, That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.
Pepper Potts, From the Strategic Homeland...
Agent Coulson, Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Pepper Potts, Right. Let's get this show on the road.
Tony," You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man."
Pepper Potts, You're not Iron Man.
Tony, Am so.
Pepper Potts, You're not.
Tony," All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night."
Pepper Potts, What night?
Tony, You know.
Pepper Potts," Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"
Tony," Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts."
James Rhodes," And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions."
Tony, Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
Christine Everhart," I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you..."
Tony," I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero."
Christine Everhart, I never said you were a superhero.
Tony," Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public."
James Rhodes," Just stick to the cards, man."
Tony," Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man."
Tony, Jarvis!
JARVIS," [distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]"
Nick Fury," ""I am Iron Man."" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet."
Tony, Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury," [appears in light] Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."
Tony, [nonchalantly] Ah.
Nick Fury, I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.
Tony, Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…
Tony, Yes
Pretty much everyone in the crowd, Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony, It’s good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd, Blow something up!
Tony," I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day."
Woman in crowd, I love you Tony!
Tony," Please, it’s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard."
Reporter," We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world."
Happy Hogan, Make sure you join me…
Tony," All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out."
Happy Hogan," Open up, let’s go."
Tony," Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you."
People," Tony, Tony"
Tony," Hey, hey."
Woman, Call me.
Happy Hogan," Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
Tony, [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.
Happy Hogan, Okay.
Tony, [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy.
Happy Hogan, This is Larry.
Tony," Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you."
Larry King, Call me. Call me.
Happy Hogan, Larry King.
Tony," Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people."
Happy Hogan," [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go."
Tony, Very mellow.
Happy Hogan, That wasn’t so bad.
Tony," No, it was perfect."
Happy Hogan," Look what we got here, the new model."
Tony," Hey, does she come with the car?"
Happy Hogan, I certainly hope so. Hi.
Tony, Hi. And you are?
Woman, Marshal.
Tony, Irish. I like it.
Marshal, Pleased to meet you Tony.
Tony, I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
Marshal, Bedford.
Tony, What are you doing here?
Marshal, Looking for you.
Tony, Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
Marshal, Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn’t take it]
Tony, Yikes.
Happy Hogan, [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn’t like to be handed things.
Tony," Yeah, I have a peeve."
Marshal, I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
Tony, Can I see a badge?
Marshal, You wanna see the badge?
Happy Hogan, He likes the badge.
Marshal, [showing him her badge.] You still like it?
Tony, Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?
Happy Hogan, D.C.? 250 miles.
Senator Stern," Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please."
Tony, [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?
Senator Stern, Can I have your attention?
Tony, Absolutely.
Stern, Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
Tony, I do not.
Stern, You do not?
Tony," I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon."
Stern, The Iron Man weapon.
Tony, My device does not fit that description.
Stern, Well… How would you describe it?
Tony," I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator."
Stern, As?
Tony, It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
Stern," It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark."
Tony," Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…"
Stern, My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
Tony," Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it."
Stern," Look, I’m no expert…"
Tony, In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
Stern," I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor."
Tony," Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance."
Justin Hammer," Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America."
Stern, That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Tony, Rhodey? What?
Tony," Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here."
Rhodey," Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on."
Tony, I just…
Rhodey, Drop it.
Tony," All right, I’ll drop it."
Stern," I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?"
Rhodey," You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?"
Stern," Yes, sir."
Rhodey, It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
Stern, I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…
Rhodey, You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…
Stern," Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you."
Rhodey," Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…"
Stern, That’s enough Colonel
Rhodey, …to fold Mr Stark…
Stern, That’s enough
Rhodey," …into the existing chain of command, Senator."
Tony," I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice."
Tony, We can amend the hours a little bit.
Stern," I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report."
Rhodey, I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.
Stern," With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images."
Rhodey," Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…"
Rhodey," … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational."
Tony," Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on."
Stern, What is he doing?
Tony," If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn’t work very well at all.]"
Stern, Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]
Tony, Iran.
Tony, No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
Tony," Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up."
TV Justin," Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
Tony," [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty."
Justin, I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.
Stern, I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…
Tony," The point is, you’re welcome, I guess"
Stern, For what?
Tony, Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
Tony, I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
Tony, What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
Stern," [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today."
Tony," [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey’s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they’re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay."
Stern, You’ve been a delight.
Tony," Wake up, Daddy’s home."
Tony, You!
Tony, I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
Tony, How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
Jarvis," We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir."
Tony, Check palladium levels.
Jarvis," Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted."
Tony," [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they’re running out quick."
Jarvis," I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core."
Jarvis," You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you."
Jarvis, Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…
Tony, Mute.
Pepper, Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
Tony, What?
Pepper, What are you thinking?
Tony," Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick."
Pepper, Did you just donate…
Tony, Keep your business.
Pepper, …our entire modern art collection to the…
Tony, Boy Scouts of America.
Pepper, …Boy Scouts of America?
Tony," Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence."
Pepper," No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that."
Tony, It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
Pepper," You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about."
Tony," [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part."
Pepper, The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
Tony, I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
Pepper, That’s rude.
Tony, There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
Pepper, The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Tony, [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
Pepper, You’ve got to be kidding.
Tony, I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
Pepper, Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
Tony, No. Our stocks have never been higher.
Pepper," Yes, from a managerial standpoint."
Tony," You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back."
Pepper, Let me give you an example.
Tony, Let’s move onto another subject.
Pepper," No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up."
Tony, I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
Tony, Let’s see what I can get going on here.
Pepper," Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people."
Tony, Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
Pepper," And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…"
Tony, Everything was my idea.
Pepper, …and you won’t make a decision.
Tony, I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.
Pepper, I do what?
Tony, Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
Pepper," Yeah, I’m trying to run the company."
Tony," Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it."
Pepper, You will not give me the information…
Tony, I’m not asking you to try…
Pepper, …in order to…
Tony, I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
Pepper, I am trying to do it.
Tony," Pepper, you’re not listening to me!"
Pepper," No, you are not listening to me."
Tony, I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
Pepper, Have you been drinking?
Tony," Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn’t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it."
Pepper, I don’t know what to think.
Tony," Don’t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]"
Pepper, The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
Tony, I’m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.
Happy, What the hell was that?
Tony, It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
Happy," It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it"
Tony," All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony’s attention shifts to her]"
Pepper, I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
Notary, I need you to initial each box.
Happy," [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off… [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]"
Tony," That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?"
Notary, Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]
Tony, Front and centre. Come into the church.
Pepper, No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…
Tony," If it pleases the court, which it does."
Natalie, [To Pepper] It’s no problem.
Pepper, [To Natalie] I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.
Tony, Can you give her a lesson?
Happy, No problem.
Tony, [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.
Pepper, What?
Tony, [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?
Pepper, She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
Tony," I need a new assistant, boss."
Pepper," Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you."
Tony, I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
Pepper," No, it’s not."
Happy, You ever boxed before?
Natalie," I have, yes."
Happy," What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]"
Tony," How do I spell your name, Natalie?"
Natalie, R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
Pepper," What, are you gonna google her now?"
Tony," I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie’s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual."
Pepper," You’re so predictable, you know that?"
Tony," She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?"
Pepper, No one speaks Latin.
Tony, No one speaks Latin
Pepper," It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin."
Tony, Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
Pepper, Well…
Tony," I need her. She’s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]"
Happy," Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]"
Pepper," Oh, my God! Happy."
Tony, That’s what I’m talking about.
Happy, I just slipped.
Tony, You did?
Happy, [Who looks a little like he’s in pain] Yeah.
Tony, Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]
Natalie, Just… I need your impression.
Tony," You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul."
Natalie, I meant your fingerprint.
Tony, Right.
Pepper," So, how are we doing?"
Tony, Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
Natalie," Will that be all, Mr Stark?"
Tony, No.
Pepper," Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]"
Tony, I want one.
Pepper, No.
Tony," You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it."
Pepper, Go with it? Go with what?
Natalie, Mr Stark?
Tony, Hey.
Natalie, Hello. How was your flight?
Tony," It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you."
Natalie," We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?"
Pepper, When did this happen?
Tony, What? You made me do it.
Pepper, I made you do what?
Tony," You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils."
Pepper, You are so predictable.
Tony, That’s the amazing thing.
Natalie, Right this way.
Tony, You look fantastic.
Natalie," Why, thank you very much."
Tony, But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
Natalie, You have a 9:30 dinner.
Tony, Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
Natalie, Absolutely.
Tony, Is this us?
Natalie, It can be.
Tony, Great. Make it us.
Natalie, Okay.
Pepper, Mr Musk. How are you?
Mr Musk," Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion."
Pepper, Thank you very much.
Tony," Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic."
Mr Musk," Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet."
Tony, You do?
Mr Musk, Yeah.
Tony, Then we’ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?
Pepper," Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage."
Tony, I’ll have Natalie make an…
Pepper, I don’t want Natalie to do…
Tony," Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you."
Pepper, Thank you very much.
Tony, Green is not your best colour. [Justin’s head appears from behind someone]
Pepper," Oh, please."
Justin, Anthony. Is that you?
Tony, [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.
Justin," Hey, pal."
Tony, Justin Hammer.
Justin, How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]
Christine, Hi. Yes.
Pepper, Yes.
Tony," Yes, roughly."
Pepper, We do.
Justin," BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries."
Christine," I know, I know."
Justin, Congratulations.
Christine, My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
Pepper, Oh.
Christine, Can I?
Pepper, Sure.
Justin," She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?"
Pepper," Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year."
Tony, And she wrote a story as well.
Pepper, It was very impressive.
Tony, That was good.
Pepper, It was very well done.
Christine, Thank you.
Pepper, I’m gonna go wash.
Tony, Don’t leave me.
Justin," Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
Tony, I’m all right.
Justin, Looking gorgeous.
Tony," Please, this is tough."
Christine, Can I ask you… Is this the first time…
Justin, [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say “Brie”.
Christine, …that you guys have seen each other?
Tony," God, that’s so awful."
Christine," Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?"
Tony, Since he got his contract revoked…
Justin," Actually, it’s on hold."
Tony, …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
Christine," Yes, what is it?"
Justin," No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo."
Tony," Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot."
Natalie, Mr Stark?
Tony, Yes?
Natalie, Your corner table is ready.
Justin," I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do."
Tony," Hammer needs a slot, Christine."
Justin," We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders."
Tony, [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?
Justin," [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…"
Justin, …is a healthy…
Tony, …and owning a race car…
Justin, …competition.
Tony, …if you don’t drive it?
Justin, Is he driving?
Pepper, Natalie. Natalie!
Natalie," Yes, Ms Potts?"
Pepper, What do you know about this?
Natalie, This is the first that I have known of it.
Pepper," This, this cannot happen."
Natalie, Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
Pepper, Where’s Happy?
Natalie, He’s waiting outside.
Pepper," Okay, get him. I need Happy."
Natalie, Right away.
Justin," Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?"
Christine," Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?"
Justin, Just read me what you wrote.
Christine," I will. I will, after."
Justin, Just read it back to me.
Christine, But I have to make one quick phone call.
Justin, Where are you going?
Christine, This is great.
Justin, I’ve got some caviar coming.
Christine, This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.
Someone in background, Look! That’s Stark.
Pepper," Go, go."
Happy," Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony’s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]"
Pepper, Give me the case.
Happy," Here, take it."
Pepper, Where’s the key?
Happy, It’s in my pocket.
Pepper, Car!
Tony, Are you okay?
Happy, Yeah.
Tony, Were you heading from me or him?
Happy, I was trying to scare him.
Tony, ‘Cause I can’t tell!
Pepper, Are you out of your mind?
Tony, Better security.
Pepper, Get in the car right now!
Tony, I was attacked. We need better security.
Happy, Get in the car.
Tony," You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing. [Ivan’s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it’s a Rolls, be nicer to her]"
Pepper, Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]
Happy, I got him!
Tony, Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
Happy, I got him.
Pepper, Take the case! Take it!
Tony, Give him the case!
Pepper, Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]
Tony, Calm down.
Pepper, God. God.
Tony," Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan’s suit.]"
Ivan, [Being taken away by the police] You… You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]
subtitled,] Where are we going?)
subtitled,] Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.)
subtitled,] Five minutes.)
Tony," Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places."
Ivan," You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed."
Tony," Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?"
Ivan, My father. Anton Vanko.
Tony," Well, I never heard of him."
Ivan, My father is the reason you’re alive.
Tony," The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed."
Ivan," Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you."
Tony, Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]
Ivan," Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]"
Stern," It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”"
Tony, Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
Pepper, What is that?
Tony, This is your in-flight meal.
Pepper, Did you just make that?
Tony, Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
Pepper," Tony, what are you not telling me?"
Tony," I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?"
Pepper," Oh, yes."
Tony, It’s a great place to be healthy.
Pepper, I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.
Tony," Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…"
Pepper," Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up."
Tony," As CEO, you are entitled to a leave."
Pepper, A leave?
Tony, A company retreat.
Pepper, A retreat? During a time like this?
Tony," Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out."
Pepper, Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.
Justin," Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you."
no subs, I am not leaving him with you.]
no subs, Let us.]
no subs," I am not leaving him, he is crazy.]"
Justin," Oui, oui. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?"
Jack, We have some salmon carpaccio.
Justin," Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony. What I saw you do to Tony on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy."
Justin, Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?
Ivan," Very good, man."
Justin," Very good, man."
Ivan," Very good, man."
Justin, Hey!
Ivan, [clinking bottle with Justin’s glass] Hey.
Justin, Yes?
Ivan, I want my bird.
Justin, A bird? You want a bird?
Ivan, I want my bird.
Justin, I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.
Ivan, I want my bird.
Justin," Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?"
Pepper," [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco."
Natalie," [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote."
Pepper, [covers speaker] Don’t tell them. Fax them…
Rhodey, [entering] Where is he?
Natalie, He doesn’t want to be disturbed.
Pepper, He’s downstairs.
Pepper," Yes, but…."
News reader," But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”"
Pepper, Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
JARVIS," Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]"
Rhodey," Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?"
Tony, Let’s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]
Rhodey," Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?"
Tony," Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?"
Rhodey, Yeah.
Tony, It’s palladium.
Rhodey, [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?
Tony," If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall."
Rhodey, You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Tony, Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?
Rhodey, I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.
Tony," You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing."
Justin," This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff."
Justin, Sorry?
Ivan, Software shit.
Justin," Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait! [Ivan pulls off one’s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it."
Ivan, What you want them do?
Justin," Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?"
Ivan, I can do that. No problem.
Justin," Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling."
Natalie," Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?"
Tony, I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
Natalie, Probably.
Tony, Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
Natalie, Ill-timed.
Tony," Right, sends the wrong message."
Natalie, Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?
Tony," Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I’ll take that. Why don’t you… [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?"
Natalie, Legal.
Tony," Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?"
Natalie," I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He’s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]"
Person, Good evening
Person, Good evening
Rhodey," Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper."
Pepper, I’m going to get some air.
Rhodey, What’s wrong?
Pepper, [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don’t know what to do.
Rhodey," You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That’s it, I’m making…."
Pepper," No, no, no. Don’t call anyone."
Rhodey, Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
Pepper," I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it."
Rhodey, Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.
Tony," [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]"
Pepper, Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
Tony, I love you.
Pepper," Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming."
Tony," No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles."
Pepper," You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?"
Tony, You’re out of control gorgeous.
Pepper, It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.
Tony, Give me another smooch
Pepper, You’re not going to be happy about this.
Tony," Come on, you know you want to."
Pepper, You just peed in the suit.
Tony, I know. It has a filtration system.
Pepper, It’s not sexy.
Tony, You could drink that water.
Pepper," Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…"
Tony, If you say so.
Pepper," Okay. I’ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]"
Tony," Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!"
Rhodey, [In full suit] I’m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
Tony, [To DJ] Goldstein.
Goldstein," Yes, Mr Stark?"
Tony, Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]
Rhodey, [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]
Tony," Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick."
Rhodey, [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?
Pepper, Natalie!
Natalie, Miss Potts.
Pepper, Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here… [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]
Happy, Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]
Tony," You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]"
Rhodey, Put you hand down.
Tony, You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
Rhodey," We don’t have to do this, Tony."
Tony," You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot."
Rhodey, Put it down!
Tony, You gonna take a shot?
Rhodey, Put it down!
Tony, No!
Rhodey, Drop it Tony!
Tony, Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony’s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]
Rhodey," Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet… [Rhodey lands in suit.]"
Major Allen, Colonel.
Rhodey, Major.
Major Allen, Wow.
Rhodey, Yeah. Let’s take it inside.
Major Allen, Clear the area.
Nick Fury, Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
Tony, [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
Fury," No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?"
Tony, It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
Fury, I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.
Tony, Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
Fury, That’s not looking so good.
Tony, I’ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can’t see her face.]
SHIELD agent, We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.
Tony, [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You’re fired.
Natalie, That’s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]
Fury," Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff."
Tony, Hi.
Agent Romanoff," I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury."
Tony, I suggest you apologise.
Fury," You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…"
Tony, You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
Fury," Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?"
Agent Romanoff," Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage."
Tony, What do you want from me?
Fury," What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him."
Tony," Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?"
Fury, What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.
Tony, Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
Agent Romanoff," It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms."
Fury, Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.
Tony," Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element."
Fury," Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all."
Justin," Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal."
Ivan, This is not my bird.
Justin," What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird."
Jack, It’s a beautiful bird.
Justin, We got this bird all the way from Russia.
Ivan," Hey, man, this is not my bird."
Justin," Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?"
Jack, No.
Justin," Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?"
Ivan, Drone better.
Justin, What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
Ivan, People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.
Justin," Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy."
Ivan," Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go."
Justin," These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan."
General, Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?
Rhodey, Fully mission-capable.
General, Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.
Rhodey, Sir?
General, Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.
Rhodey," Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…"
General," Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen."
Rhodey," Yes, General, but…"
General, It’s also an order.
Rhodey, Yes sir.
General," Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud."
Rhodey, Thank you sir.
Fury, That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
Tony," No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…"
Fury," No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery."
Tony," Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?"
Fury," Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco."
Tony, You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
Fury, He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
Tony, He said that?
Fury," Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart."
Tony," I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan."
Fury, What do you remember about your dad?
Tony," He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school."
Fury, That’s not true.
Tony," Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did."
Fury," As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD."
Tony, What?
Fury, I got a two o’clock
Tony," Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?"
Fury," Okay, you’re good, right?"
Tony," No, I’m not good."
Fury, You got this? Right? Right?
Tony, Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
Fury," Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?"
Tony, Yeah.
Fury," And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]"
Tony," [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice."
Agent Coulson," I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?"
Tony," I think I got it, yeah."
Agent Coulson, Enjoy your evening’s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]
Major Allen, Think this is the power source?
Rhodey," Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?"
Major Allen," Yes, sir."
Justin," [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?"
Rhodey," Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us."
Justin," What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…"
Rhodey, That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.
Justin," Well, you’re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you."
Rhodey, I think I’ll take it.
Justin, Which one?
Rhodey, All of it.
Justin, All of it.
Howard, I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and… [Video changes]
Man, Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]
Howard," So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends."
Strawberry man, $6. Six.
Tony, I don’t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]
Strawberry man," No, sir, that’s too much."
Tony," No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine"
Strawberry man," No, señor."
Tony," Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great."
Strawberry man, Are you Iron Man?
Tony, Sometimes.
Strawberry man, [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!
Pepper, It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
PA, Miss Potts?
Tony, Relax.
PA, Mr Stark…
Tony, Is here.
PA, He refuses…
Tony, I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
Pepper," No, the suit belongs to us."
News reporter, We trusted that he would look out for us.
Pepper," Yeah, but you’re not…"
News reporter, He obviously did not.
Pepper, Burt…
News reporter, And now we learn that his secretary…
Pepper," Yes, it does."
News reporter," …a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?"
Pepper, No.
News reporter, Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…
Tony, Mute.
Pepper," No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this."
Tony, [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I’ll get this stuff out of here.
Pepper," Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony be there?"
Tony, [Pulling up a chair] Will I?
Pepper," No, he will not. Bye."
Tony, I would like to be. Got a minute?
Pepper, No.
Tony," Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds."
Pepper, Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
Tony," I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not."
Pepper, You didn’t come here to apologise?
Tony," Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…"
Pepper, No.
Tony," Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it."
Pepper," Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?"
Tony, Yes.
Pepper," People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?"
Tony, Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
Pepper, I need you…
Tony, I need you too.
Pepper, …to leave now
Tony, That’s what I’m trying to…
Natasha, [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?
Pepper," Hi, come on in."
Natasha, Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Pepper, Thank you.
Happy," Anything else, boss?"
Tony," I’m good, Hap."
Pepper," No, I’ll be just another minute."
Tony," I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?"
Pepper, No. That’s not so.
Tony, It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
Pepper," Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings."
Natasha, Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Tony," Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?"
Natasha, [Latin]
Tony, Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
Natasha, It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]
Tony, You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
Tony," Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection."
Jarvis," 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir."
Tony, [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?
Jarvis, Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
Tony, That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
Jarvis," What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?"
Tony," I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]"
Jarvis, The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Tony, Thank Dad.
Jarvis," Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise."
Tony," Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode."
Agent Coulson, I heard you broke the perimeter.
Tony," Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?"
Agent Coulson, I was doing some stuff.
Tony," Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?"
Agent Coulson, [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What’s this doing here?
Tony, That’s it. Bring that to me.
Agent Coulson, You know what this is?
Tony," [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?"
Agent Coulson, Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
Tony, Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
Agent Coulson, So I’m told.
Tony, Secret stuff?
Agent Coulson, Something like that. Good luck.
Tony, Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]
Agent Coulson, We need you.
Tony," Yeah, more than you know."
Agent Coulson, Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]
Jarvis," Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it’s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]"
Tony, That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]
Jarvis," Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics."
Ivan, The drone is not going to be ready.
Justin, Not ready? What do you mean?
Ivan," I can make presentation, not demonstration."
Justin, What the hell is the difference?
Ivan, Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Justin," Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration."
Ivan, I can make salute.
Justin," You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]"
Ivan," Hey, man, everything will be okay."
Justin, This is not what I wanted.
Justin," Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird."
Ivan, [As man grabs bird] Hey!
Justin," Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?"
Ivan, [Russian] ты слишком много говоришь. [no subs in the movie;You talk too much.]
Justin," I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]"
Tony," Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…"
Jarvis, Incoming call with a blocked number sir.
Tony, My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
Ivan," Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle."
Tony, You what?
Ivan, You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.
Tony, You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
Ivan, You too.
Tony, [mutes his speaker] Trace him.
Jarvis, Sir.
Ivan," Now, the true history of Stark name will be written."
Tony," Jarvis, where is he?"
Jarvis, Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
Ivan," What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes."
Tony, Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
Jarvis, Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
Ivan, I hope you’re ready. [Call ends]
Jarvis, Call trace incomplete.
Jarvis, Sir
Tony," You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now."
Jarvis, We are unclear as to the effects.
Tony," I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!"
Happy," I’ll keep the car down here, all right?"
Pepper, Thank you Happy.
Announcer, …Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
Justin," Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad."
Pepper," Oh, Lord."
Justin," Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes."
Pepper, What? [Rises and salutes.]
Justin," For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… [incoming Iron Man]"
Tony, We got trouble.
Rhodey," Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now."
Tony, Give them a wave.
Justin," Hey, all right. Yeah."
Tony, All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Rhodey," Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?"
Tony," Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko."
Rhodey, Vanko’s alive?
Justin, Yeah. [Tony approaches him]
Tony, What is he?
Justin, What?
Tony, Where’s Vanko?
Justin, Who?
Tony, Tell me.
Justin, What are you doing here man?
Rhodey," Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Tony, [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?
Rhodey," No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised."
Tony, [Takes off] Let’s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]
Rhodey," No, no!"
Tony," Jarvis, break in. I need to own him."
Jarvis, Yes sir.
Rhodey," Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock."
Tony, On what?
Rhodey," On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!"
Justin, [Running to a computer] What’s going on? What’s happening?
Technician, The software’s been overridden.
Justin, What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?
Technician, I think he slaved the drones.
Justin, That’s impossible. Call the guards.
Jack, All the phones are down sir.
Justin," Well, then call their… Call their cells."
Jack, Their cell phones are not working either sir.
Technician, He’s locked us out of the mainframe.
Pepper, [Entering] Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?
Justin," Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled."
Pepper, Have you now?
Justin," Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?"
Natasha, [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?
Justin, Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
Natasha, Where is he?
Justin, At my facility.
Pepper," I need NYPD, please."
Justin," No, no, no!"
Pepper, Command Central.
Justin," No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities."
Pepper, Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.
Tony, How are we doing Jarvis?
Jarvis, Remote reboot unsuccessful.
Security guard, This way.
Happy, Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?
Natasha, Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
Happy, I’m not taking you anywhere.
Natasha, Fine. You want me to drive?
Happy," No, I’m driving. Get in the car."
Tony, Nice work kid. [Takes off again]
Rhodey, You got multiples coming in on you.
Tony, Let’s get this away from the Expo.
Natasha," Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She’s getting undressed in the back of the car] I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road."
Happy, I got it. I got it.
Rhodey," Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo."
Tony, Got it.
Rhodey, In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.
Natasha, Stay in the car.
Happy, I’m not staying in the car.
Natasha," I said, stay in the car."
Happy," [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone."
Natasha, You want to help? Keep the car running.
Happy, [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.
Hammer security guard," Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here."
Second guard, Hold on. Hey!
Technician, Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.
Pepper," Well, choose one and focus on that."
Justin, Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?
Announcement, Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
Security guard, We got it. We’re on our way.
Happy, I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done
Tony," Rhodey, you still locked on?"
Rhodey, Yeah.
Tony, Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
Rhodey," Wait, wait, wait!"
Natasha, He’s gone.
Tony, I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
Happy, What are you doing?
Natasha, I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.
Rhodey, Tony.
Natasha, Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.
Tony," Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff."
Natasha, Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Tony," Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you."
Pepper, [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?
Tony," Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]"
Pepper, What’s going on?
Tony, I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
Pepper, You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
Tony, You didn’t let me.
Pepper, Why didn’t you tell me that?
Tony, I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Natasha," Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you."
Tony, Great. Pepper?
Pepper, Are you okay now?
Tony, I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
Pepper, I am mad!
Tony, …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
Pepper, Fine.
Tony, We could have been in Venice.
Pepper, Oh please.
Tony," Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up."
Rhodey," [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back."
Tony, [Helps him up] You okay?
Rhodey," Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?"
Tony, Don’t be.
Rhodey, No. I should have trusted you more.
Tony, I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
Rhodey, No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
Tony," Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?"
Rhodey," Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge."
Tony, Got you. Where do you want to be?
Rhodey, Where are you going?
Tony, What’re you talking about?
Rhodey, I meant me.
Tony, You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
Rhodey," Tony, don’t be jealous."
Tony, No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
Rhodey, Yeah. It’s called being a badass.
Tony, Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
Rhodey, Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
Tony," Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?"
Rhodey," It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]"
Tony, See that?
Rhodey," Yeah, yeah. Nice."
Tony, Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.]
Rhodey, Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Tony, Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
Justin, I told you that five minutes ago.
Pepper, [As police enter] That’s your guy here.
Justin, Excuse me?
Police officer, You’re being placed under arrest.
Justin, Are you kidding me?
Police officer, Hands behind your back sir.
Justin," I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon."
Pepper," [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits."
Police officer, We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Pepper," Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines."
Police officer, Yeah. Are you coming with us?
Pepper," No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear."
Police officer, Okay.
Natasha, Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Ivan, [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.
Rhodey, This ain’t gonna be good. [Ivan’s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
Tony," With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?"
Rhodey, Yeah.
Tony," I got this. [Targets points on Ivan’s armour. Doesn’t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan’s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?"
Rhodey, What?
Tony, I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
Rhodey, This is your idea?
Tony, Yep.
Rhodey," I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!"
Tony," Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]"
Ivan, You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]
Rhodey, All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.
Tony, Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]
Pepper, Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.
Tony, You can’t?
Pepper, I can’t take this.
Tony, Look at me.
Pepper," My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company."
Tony, I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]
Pepper, I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.
Tony," What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses."
Pepper, I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.
Tony, You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
Pepper," No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified."
Tony," Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better."
Pepper, Well…
Tony," You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?"
Pepper, Thank you.
Tony, Yeah.
Pepper, Thank you for understanding.
Tony," Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up."
Pepper, I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.
Tony, Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
Pepper," Well, with you it’s like dog years."
Tony, I know.
Pepper," I mean, it’s like the Presidency. [They kiss]"
Tony, Weird.
Pepper," No, it’s not weird."
Tony," It’s okay, right?"
Pepper, Yeah.
Tony, Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]
Rhodey, I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
Pepper," I had just quit, actually."
Tony," Yeah, so we’re not…"
Rhodey, You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
Tony, You should get lost.
Rhodey, I was here first. Get a roof.
Tony, I thought you were out of one-liners.
Rhodey, That’s the last one.
Tony," You kicked ass back there, by the way."
Rhodey," Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?"
Tony, Not okay. Not okay with that.
Rhodey, It wasn’t a question. [Takes off]
Tony, How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
Fury," I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]"
Tony," “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it."
Fury, Read on.
Tony, “Tony not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony’s chair]
Fury, Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]
Tony," [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury’s] You can’t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter."
Fury, I’ll see what I can do.
Stern," It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this."
Rhodey, Thank you sir.
Stern," Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo."
Happy Hogan, (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.
Tony," Hey, do you want...?"
Party Guest," Tony? Great speech, man!"
Happy Hogan," I got you, pal."
Tony, I gave a speech? How was it?
Happy Hogan, Edifying
Maya Hansen, Unintelligible.
Tony, Really?
Maya Hansen, Mmm-hmm.
Tony," It's my favorite kind, a winning combo."
Maya Hansen, Where are we going?
Tony," Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research."
Maya Hansen," Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my ""town."""
Ho Yinsen, Mr. Stark
Tony," Oh, I finally met a man called ""Ho."""
Ho Yinsen," I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu."
Tony," [to Wu] Oh, this guy."
Ho Yinsen, Mr. Stark.
Tony," Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)"
Maya Hansen, Bye.
Ho Yinsen, Perhaps another time.
Aldrich Killian, Mr. Stark!
Aldrich Killian," Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian. (Stuttering to Maya) I'm a big fan of your work!"
Maya Hansen, My work?
Tony, Who isn't? He means me.
Aldrich Killian," Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT."
Happy Hogan," Yeah, we're full."
Tony," Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut."
Happy Hogan," What floor are you going to, pal?"
Aldrich Killian," Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately-funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. [He holds out two business cards towards Tony and Maya]"
Tony, Uh... she'll take both.
Maya Hansen, Okay. [takes the cards]
Tony, One to throw away and one to not call.
Aldrich Killian," Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?"
Tony," I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt."
Aldrich Killian, Aw!
Tony," (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first."
Maya Hansen," (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you."
Tony, I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
Aldrich Killian, Yeah?
Tony," Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. [steps out of the elevator] I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?"
Aldrich Killian, I'll see you up there.
Tony, Damn betcha.
Tony, Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Maya Hansen," Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair..."
Tony, Wow.
Maya Hansen, ...And chemically recode it.
Tony, That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
Both, ...Genetic operating system...
Tony, ...of a...
Maya Hansen, Exactly.
Tony, ...living organism.
Maya Hansen, Yes.
Tony, Wow.
Maya Hansen, Is that... Can you...
Happy Hogan, What?
Maya Hansen, Can you not touch my plant? It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...
Tony, She's not like the others.​​​​​​ (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
Maya Hansen," That's cute, but..."
Tony, Leave her ficus alone.
Maya Hansen," [turns to Hogan] Because... and, no, seriously don't. [walks into the bedroom]"
Tony, And you're starting with plants?
Maya Hansen," For now, yeah."
Tony, Huh.
Maya Hansen, I'm calling it Extremis.
Maya Hansen," Well, it's..."
Both, Human application.
Maya Hansen, Exactly! Exactly.
Maya Hansen, Dendritic revitalization.
Tony, It's revolutionary.
Maya Hansen, Disease prevention...
Tony, Changes the world.
Maya Hansen, ...even limb regrowth.
Tony, You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
Maya Hansen, Wow.
Tony, In Switzerland.
Maya Hansen," Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things."
Tony, This week.
Tony," You almost bought it, didn't you?"
Maya Hansen," This is what I'm talking about, the glitch."
Tony, Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
Maya Hansen, The what?
Happy Hogan," Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss."
Tony, We're good.
Happy Hogan, Stay down.
Tony, You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?
Happy Hogan, What was that?
Maya Hansen, It's a glitch in my work. It's...
Tony, She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
Happy Hogan, It's not Y2K.
Maya Hansen, No.
Tony, Hey!
Happy Hogan, Happy New Year.
Tony, Happy New Year.
Maya Hansen, Happy New Year.
Tony," Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight."
Happy Hogan, You good?
Tony, Yep.
Happy Hogan, I'll be right outside.
Tony, Okay.
Tony," [voice over] So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it."
Tony," [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am."
Tony, Ow!
JARVIS," Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate..."
Tony, No. Forty-eight. [he injects himself] Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
JARVIS," As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."
Tony," Which I will. Right, let's do this."
Tony," Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it."
Tony," Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it."
JARVIS," Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours."
Tony," Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother."
Tony," Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence."
Tony," Jarvis, drop my needle."
Tony, Crap.
Tony," Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all."
Tony," Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a..."
Tony, ...little bit.
Tony," Cool it, will you, Jarvis?"
Tony, Come on. I ain't scared of you.
Tony, I'm the best.
JARVIS," As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work."
Tony, [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
Tony, [voice over] That's when he happened.
The Mandarin," Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming."
President Ellis," Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot."
Bill Maher, And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.
Joan Rivers," Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle."
Colonel James Rhodes," It tested well with focus groups, alright?"
Tony, [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...
Colonel James Rhodes," Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message."
Tony," So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?"
Colonel James Rhodes," It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings."
Tony, Nine.
Colonel James Rhodes," The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings."
Tony," You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air."
Colonel James Rhodes, When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Tony, Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
Colonel James Rhodes," People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you."
Tony, You're gonna come at me like that?
Colonel James Rhodes," No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic..."
Colonel James Rhodes, ...tator.
Erin, Do you mind signing my drawing?
Tony," If Richard doesn't mind. [to Rhodes] You alright with this, Dick?"
Colonel James Rhodes, Fine with me.
Tony, [To the girl] What's your name?
Erin, Erin.
Tony," I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way."
Colonel James Rhodes," Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not..."
Tony," It's not superhero business, I get it."
Colonel James Rhodes," No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business."
Tony, That's why I said I...got it.
Colonel James Rhodes, Are you okay?
Tony, I broke the crayon.
Erin," Are you okay, Mr. Stark?"
Colonel James Rhodes, Take it easy. Tony...
Little Boy, [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?
Colonel James Rhodes, Wait a minute! Tony!
Tony, What'd he say?!
Colonel James Rhodes, Tony!
Tony, Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
Tony," Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?"
JARVIS, No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.
Tony," Okay, so I was poisoned?"
Jarvis, My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
Tony, Me?
Colonel James Rhodes," Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up."
Tony," Sorry, I gotta split."
Happy Hogan," Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use."
Pepper Potts," Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?"
Happy Hogan, What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.
Pepper Potts, What!?
Happy Hogan," [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi."
Pepper Potts, [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?
Happy Hogan, Security.
Pepper Potts, Happy?
Happy Hogan, Yes.
Pepper Potts," Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you."
Happy Hogan, Thank you.
Pepper Potts, However...
Happy Hogan, I do appreciate it
Pepper Potts, Since you've taken the post...
Happy Hogan, You don't have to thank me.
Pepper Potts, We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent
Happy Hogan, Thank you.
Pepper Potts, That's not a compliment.
Happy Hogan, That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.
Pepper Potts, I...
s Assistant, Excuse me.
Pepper Potts, Yes?
s Assistant," Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here."
Pepper Potts, Thank you.
Happy Hogan, Did you clear this four o'clock with me?
Pepper Potts," Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing."
Happy Hogan, How so?
Pepper Potts," I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward."
Happy Hogan, I don't like the sound of that.
Aldrich Killian, Pepper.
Pepper Potts, Killian?
Aldrich Killian, You look great. You look really great.
Pepper Potts," God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?"
Aldrich Killian," Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich."
Happy Hogan, Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
Pepper Potts," Happy, it's okay."
Happy Hogan, Yes?
Pepper Potts, We're good.
Happy Hogan, You sure?
Pepper Potts, Yes. Stand down.
Happy Hogan," Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here."
Pepper Potts, Thank you.
Happy Hogan, Okay.
Pepper Potts," It's very nice to see you, Killian."
Happy Hogan," Hey, guy."
Savin, Merry Christmas.
Aldrich Killian," After years dodging the President's ban on ""immoral biotech research"", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down."
Aldrich Killian, Regard the human brain.
Aldrich Killian," Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that..."
Aldrich Killian," That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?"
Aldrich Killian," Thanks, it's mine."
Pepper Potts, What?
Aldrich Killian, This...you're inside my head. It's a...
Aldrich Killian," It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you."
Aldrich Killian, Come on.
Aldrich Killian," Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me."
Pepper Potts, What is that?
Aldrich Killian, It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.
Aldrich Killian," Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded."
Pepper Potts, Wow.
Happy Hogan, Hello?
Tony, Is this forehead of Security?
Happy Hogan," What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here."
Tony, What? Harassing interns?
Happy Hogan," Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face."
Happy Hogan," I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper."
Tony, What's going on? Fill me in.
Happy Hogan, For real?
Tony, Yeah.
Happy Hogan," Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome."
Tony, Right.
Happy Hogan," I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces."
Tony," Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best."
Happy Hogan," Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?"
Tony, Um...Switzerland.
Happy Hogan," Right, right, exactly."
Tony," Killian? No, I don't remember that guy."
Happy Hogan," Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain."
Tony, His what?
Happy Hogan," Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]"
Tony, Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
Happy Hogan," I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here."
Tony," Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing."
Happy Hogan, I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.
Happy Hogan," Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty."
Tony, Relax.
Happy Hogan, Seriously?
Tony, I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
Happy Hogan," You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her."
Tony, A giant brain?
Happy Hogan," Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it."
Tony," I miss you, Happy."
Happy Hogan," Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird..."
Tony," Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?"
Happy Hogan, Why?
Tony," I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her."
Happy Hogan," Yeah, nice."
Aldrich Killian, Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.
Pepper Potts, It would be incredible.
Aldrich Killian, Mm.
Pepper Potts," Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not..."
Aldrich Killian," Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego."
Pepper Potts," It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you."
Aldrich Killian," Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'"
Pepper Potts, That's very deep.
Aldrich Killian, Mm
Pepper Potts, And I have no idea what it means.
Aldrich Killian," Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man."
Aldrich Killian," I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper."
Pepper Potts, Happy...
Happy Hogan," The car is ready, if you're ready to go."
Pepper Potts," Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna..."
Pepper Potts, I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!
Pepper Potts," You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?"
Tony, Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
Pepper Potts," Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?"
Tony," Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so."
Tony," Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?"
Pepper Potts," Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?"
Tony," Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall."
Pepper Potts, Okay.
Tony," So, uh...tense? Good day?"
Tony," Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?"
Pepper Potts, Did I like it?
Tony," Nailed it, right?"
Pepper Potts, Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.
Pepper Potts, So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
Tony," Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the..."
Pepper Potts, Uh-huh.
Tony, The facial slit?
Pepper Potts," Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?"
Tony, Crowbar. Yeah.
Tony," Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak."
Pepper Potts, I'll take my chances.
Tony, That's risky.
Tony, At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
Tony, Busted.
Pepper Potts, This is a new level of lame.
Tony, Sorry.
Pepper Potts," You ate without me, already? On date night?"
Tony, [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...
Pepper Potts, You mean you?
Tony," Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work."
Pepper Potts, Uh-huh.
Tony," And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian."
Pepper Potts, What?
Tony, What?
Pepper Potts, Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?
Tony, Happy was concerned.
Pepper Potts," No, you're spying on me."
Tony, I wasn't...
Pepper Potts, I'm going to bed.
Tony, Hold on. Come on. Pep.
Tony," Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry."
Tony," I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything."
Tony, Nothing's been the same since New York.
Pepper Potts," Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all."
Tony," You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker."
Tony," But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh..."
Pepper Potts, Machines.
Tony, They're part of me.
Pepper Potts, A distraction.
Tony, Maybe.
Pepper Potts, I'm gonna take a shower.
Tony, Okay.
Pepper Potts, And you're gonna join me.
Tony, Better.
Pepper Potts, Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...
Tony, Power down!
Tony," I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?"
Tony," Don't go, alright? Pepper?"
Pepper Potts, I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.
Savin, Can you regulate?
Taggert," Yes, I can regulate."
Savin, Are you sure about that?
Taggert, Yes.
Savin, It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.
Taggert, Thank you...I mean for understanding.
Happy Hogan," I'm sorry, buddy."
Savin," What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?"
Happy Hogan," Yeah, a little movie called ""The Party's Over"", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]"
Savin," No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face twice, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]"
Taggert, Savin!
Savin, What?
Taggert," Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened]"
The Mandarin," True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation."
Tony, Hi.
s Nurse, Oh.
Tony, [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?
s Nurse, Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]
Tony," Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave]"
Hospital News Reporter, We're awaiting the arrival of Tony. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]
Pushy Tabloid Reporter," Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]"
Tony," Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided [He removes his sunglasses and stares into the phone's camera] that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] That's what you wanted, right? [He takes the phone and throws it at a wall] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off]"
JARVIS," I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]"
Tony," Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the King"". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]"
JARVIS, The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.
Tony, No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
JARVIS," No, sir."
Tony," Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?"
JARVIS," Not according to public records, sir."
Tony," Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees."
JARVIS, The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
Tony," Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?"
JARVIS, It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Tony, Bring her around.
JARVIS, The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]
Tony," That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?"
JARVIS," Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]"
Tony," Are we still at ""ding-dong""? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?"
JARVIS," There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]"
Tony," Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?"
Maya Hansen, You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?
Tony," Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast."
JARVIS," Gluten-free waffles, sir."
Tony, That's right.
Maya Hansen," Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent."
Tony," Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her."
Pepper Potts," Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]"
Tony," Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. [Maya smiles] Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met."
Maya Hansen," He's thirteen. And no, I need your help."
Tony, What...what for? Why now?
Maya Hansen," Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week."
Tony, I'll be fine.
Pepper Potts," I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests."
Tony, We weren't.
Maya Hansen," No, I..."
Pepper Potts, And old girlfriends!
Tony, She's not really.
Maya Hansen," No, not really. It...it was just one night."
Tony, Yep.
Pepper Potts," That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep."
Tony, It was a great night.
Pepper Potts," Well, you know..."
Maya Hansen, Yeah.
Pepper Potts, You have saved yourself a world of pain.
Maya Hansen, I'm sure.
Tony, What?
Pepper Potts, Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.
Tony," Okay, we've been through this. Nope."
Pepper Potts, Yep!
Tony, The man says no.
Pepper Potts, Immediately and indefinitely!
Tony, Honey...
Maya Hansen, Great idea. Let's go.
Tony, I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
Pepper Potts," Tony, this is how normal people behave."
Tony, I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]
Maya Hansen, Is...is that normal?
Tony," Yes, this is normal!"
Pepper Potts," Sadly, that...is very normal."
Tony," It's a big bunny, relax about it!"
Pepper Potts, Calm down!
Tony, I got this for you.
Pepper Potts, I'm aware of that.
Tony, You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
Pepper Potts, I don't like it!
Tony," I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]"
Pepper Potts," Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion."
Tony, I said no.
Maya Hansen," Guys, can we um..."
Tony, What?
Maya Hansen," [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house] Do we need to worry about that? [The house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit]"
Pepper Potts, I got you.
Tony," I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor between Pepper and Tony collapses] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]"
Pepper Potts, Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]
JARVIS," Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]"
Tony," Jarvis, where's my flight power?!"
JARVIS," Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it]"
Tony, That's one.
JARVIS," Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]"
Tony," That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean. In the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]"
Pepper Potts, Tony!
JARVIS," Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.]"
JARVIS, Sir. Sir!
Tony," Alright, kill the alarm. I got it."
JARVIS," That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]"
Tony," It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?"
JARVIS," We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee."
Tony," Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta..."
JARVIS, I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.
Tony, Who asked you? Open the suit.
JARVIS," I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir."
Tony, Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather.] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
JARVIS," I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]"
Tony," Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]"
Computer Voice, Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.
Tony," Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm, a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]"
Harley Keener, Freeze! Don't move.
Tony," You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo."
Harley Keener, What's that thing on your chest?
Tony," It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here."
Harley Keener, What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?
Tony," Technically, I am."
Harley Keener," Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']"
Tony, A valid point.
Harley Keener, [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?
Tony," Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him."
Harley Keener, Like a mechanic?
Tony, Yeah.
Harley Keener, Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.
Tony, [Interupting Harley] It's Iron Patriot now.
Harley Keener, That's way cooler!
Tony," No, it's not."
Harley Keener," Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro..."
Tony, Retroreflective panels?
Harley Keener, To make him stealth mode.
Tony, You want a stealth mode?
Harley Keener," Cool, right?"
Tony, That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
Harley Keener," [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!"
Tony," Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone."
Harley Keener, S...Sorry.
Tony," Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?"
Harley Keener," Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago."
Tony," Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich."
Harley Keener, What's in it for me?
Tony, Salvation. What's his name?
Harley Keener, Who?
Tony," The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?"
Harley Keener, How'd you know that?
Tony," I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?"
Harley Keener, Deal.
Tony, Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?
Harley Keener, Harley. And you're...
Tony," The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? [back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks out across the ocean. She sees one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets and pulls it towards her, her forehead resting against the helmet's. She sees a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier]"
Computer Voice, Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.
Tony," Pepper, it's me. [Pepper gasps and smiles] I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again."
Pepper Potts, Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
Maya Hansen," [A beat] I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe."
Pepper Potts," Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so..."
Maya Hansen," That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist."
Pepper Potts," This boss of yours, does he have a name?"
Maya Hansen," Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock]"
Savin," Well, we took the house down, sir..."
Aldrich Killian, Mmhmm.
Savin, But there's no sign of a body.
Aldrich Killian, I see.
Savin, No Stark.
Aldrich Killian," I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face."
Out," The Master is travelling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]"
The Mandarin, Well then. What are we waiting for?
Tony," The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]"
Harley Keener," She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?"
Tony," Maybe never, relax about it."
Harley Keener," What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?"
Tony," I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?"
Harley Keener," I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]"
Tony," Six people died, right?"
Harley Keener, Yeah.
Tony, Including Chad Davis?
Harley Keener, Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]
Tony," Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows."
Harley Keener," Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five."
Tony, Do you buy that?
Harley Keener, That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?
Tony, No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
Harley Keener," That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?"
Tony, That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Harley Keener, Are they coming back? The aliens?
Tony," Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?"
Harley Keener, Does this subject make you...make you edgy?
Tony," Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?"
Harley Keener, Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?
Tony, Nope.
Harley Keener, Do you need to be on it?
Tony, Probably.
Harley Keener, Do you have PTSD?
Tony, I don't think so.
Harley Keener," Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?"
Tony," Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?"
Harley Keener," What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]"
Tony," Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?"
Harley Keener, Where she always is.
Tony," See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]"
Brandt, Thank you. [Tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]
Tony," Nice haircut, suits you."
Brandt, Nice watch.
Tony," Yeah, limited edition."
Brandt," Oh, I don't doubt it. [there's a moment's pause] Well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [Tony enters the bar and walks up to Mrs. Davis, who's sat at table drinking alone]"
Tony," Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?"
 Davis, Free country.
Tony," It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]"
 Davis, Alright. Where'd you like to start?
Tony, I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
 Davis," Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]"
Tony," Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?"
 Davis, Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]
Tony," Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him."
 Davis, What?
Tony, As a weapon.
 Davis," You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]"
Brandt," Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outside the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]"
Rose Hills Sheriff," Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?"
Brandt," It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?"
Rose Hills Sheriff," Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?"
Brandt, Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?
Rose Hills Sheriff," No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that."
Brandt," Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff."
Rose Hills Sheriff," Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]"
Brandt," Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]"
Rose Hills Sheriff," Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]"
Tony," Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?"
Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper, Yeah.
Tony," Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]"
Brandt, That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
Tony," Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony stumbles out of the shop as people run past. A water tank falls down and traps Tony's leg. He finds that Savin has grabbed Harley]"
Harley Keener, Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley]
Savin," Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?"
Harley Keener," Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!"
Savin," Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, ""I want my god damn file."""
Tony," It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. [Harley uses the gadget Tony gave him earlier and runs away] Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. [Tony brings up his hand and reveals his Iron Man suit hand. He fires at Savin and sends him flying backwards. Tony makes his way out of the rubble before leaving.]"
Harley Keener, You're welcome
Tony, For what? Did I miss something?
Harley Keener, Me saving your life
Tony," Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose."
Harley Keener," Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected."
Tony," What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. [Tony gets in his car] I'm sorry, kid, you did good."
Harley Keener," So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?"
Tony," Yep [A beat] Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?"
Harley Keener, [Childishly] I'm cold.
Tony, [Mocking him] I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. [Tony drives away]
Harley Keener, It was worth a shot.
Government Employee," Mr Vice President, I think you should see this."
Vice President," Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?"
The Mandarin," Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards. [The screen zooms out to show a man lying on the floor while Mandarin points a gun at him] Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation. [Thomas sobs] But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds."
Thomas Richards, No!
The Mandarin," The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!"
President Ellis, I have to make this call.
President Ellis, This is the right thing to do. [The phone rings but Mandarin doesn't answer. He waits for a few seconds before firing the gun.]
The Mandarin," There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon."
President Ellis," Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now."
Military Aide," Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike."
President Ellis, Right now.
Military Aide," Yes, sir."
Tony," Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-"
Rhodey, Don't move! (His phone rings.) Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?
Tony," You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?"
Rhodey," Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?"
Tony," It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?"
Rhodey," A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?"
Tony," Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?"
Rhodey, Yeah.
Tony," I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login."
Rhodey," It's the same as it's always been, ""WarMachine68."""
Tony," And password, please."
Rhodey," Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony."
Tony," It's not the '80s, nobody says ""hack"" any more. Give me your login. (Rhodey sighs.)"
Rhodey," ""WAR MACHINE ROX"" with an ""X,"" all caps."
Tony," (He's laughing.) That is so much better than ""lron Patriot."""
EMCEE, Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?
Elk Ridge," Well, David..."
Crew, Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...
EMCEE," One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right."
Cameraman, Because you erase my shows!
Tony, That ain't gonna cut it.
Cameraman," We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who... (Tony turns around.)"
Tony, Shh.
Cameraman," Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony is in my van."
Tony, Shh. Keep it down.
Cameraman, Tony is in my van!
Tony," No, he's not."
Cameraman, I knew you were still alive!
Tony, Come on in. Close the door. (The cameraman gets in the van & closes the door.) Shh...
Cameraman," Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir..."
Tony, Yep.
Cameraman, I am your biggest fan.
Tony," Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?"
Cameraman," No, no, no. Just us."
Tony, Great. What's your name?
Cameraman, Gary
Tony, Gary?
Gary," Oh, wow."
Tony, Right there is fine.
Gary, Okay.
Tony," Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay."
Gary," Oh, good. Can I just say?"
Tony, What do you want?
Gary," Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little..."
Tony, It's fine.
Gary," It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it."
Tony, Right.
Gary," I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!"
Tony, A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?
Gary," Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit..."
Tony," Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%."
Gary, Got it.
Tony, All right? It's a mission.
Gary, Yeah.
Tony, Tony needs Gary.
Gary, And Gary needs Tony.
Tony, Be quiet about it. Go.
Gary, Yeah.
Aldrich Killian, What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?
Chad Davis," Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me. (Tony types again and another video shows up.)"
Aldrich Killian, Will you please state your name for the camera?
Brandt, Ellen Brandt.
Aldrich Killian," Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. (More typing, another video.) Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. (Brandt's missing arm grows back as she glows red. The other volunteers glow red & scream too.) We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here! (One of the volunteers exploads.)"
Tony," (He's muttering.) A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal."
Maya Hansen," What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore."
Pepper Potts," You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank."
Maya Hansen," Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts."
Pepper Potts," That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself."
Maya Hansen," Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. (Someone knocks on the door & Pepper looks over. She gets up & opens the door. Room service pushes in a tray of food but Killain appears & snaps his neck. Pepper gasps.)"
Pepper Potts," Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck."
Aldrich Killian," Hi, Pepper. (To Maya) So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?"
Maya Hansen, I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Aldrich Killian," Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?"
Maya Hansen," I've told you, Killian, we can use him."
Aldrich Killian, Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Maya Hansen," Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one."
Man, [On radio] This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Rhodey," Copy. [Repulsor firing, people shrieking] Nobody move. [Women exclaiming in fear] Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure. [One of the women shakes Rhodey's hand and her hand glows red. Rhodey falls backwards, grunting.]"
Woman, Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
Rhodey," If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it."
Woman," That's the plan, Colonel."
Tony," Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report."
Harley Keener," Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?"
Tony, How much have you had?
Harley Keener, Two or three bowls.
Tony, Can you still see straight?
Harley Keener, Sort of.
Tony," That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?"
JARVIS," It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal."
Tony," What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?"
JARVIS," Actually, sir, it's in Miami."
Tony," Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is."
Harley Keener," Um, it does say Miami, Florida."
Tony," Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?"
Harley Keener," Uh, it's not charging. [Tony pulls over to the side of the road, heavy breathing]"
JARVIS," Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42."
Tony," What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... [Breathing heavily] Oh, God, not again."
Harley Keener, Tony? [Tony gets out of the car] Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.
Tony," Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it."
Harley Keener," Okay, um, uh..."
Tony," [Panting] God, what am I gonna do?"
Harley Keener," Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?"
Tony, Right.
Harley Keener, You said so.
Tony," Yes, I did."
Harley Keener, Why don't you just build something?
Tony," Okay. Thanks, kid. [He gets back in the car.] [Cut to Tony in a shop buying supplies.] [Cut to Tony building something.] [Cut to Miama, Florida. Tony climbs a wall and begins fighting guards. He makes his way into the house and finds a woman lying on a table.] [Cut to a different woman lying on a sofa with a man sitting at a desk.]"
Woman, Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.
Man," [Scoffs] My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con... [Tony puts a gloved hand on his head, electrocuting him. He gets the gun and leaves the room. He makes his way to the bedroom and pulls the duvet off the bed, revealling two girls. Tony sushes them and the toilet flushes.]"
The Mandarin," Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. [He laughs] Now, which one of you is Vanessa?"
Vanessa, That's me.
The Mandarin, Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
Vanessa, There's some guy over here.
The Mandarin," They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe."
Tony, Hey! [Mandarin raises his hands]
The Mandarin, Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Tony, Don't move.
The Mandarin, I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
Tony, What?
The Mandarin," Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?"
Tony," Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?"
The Mandarin," Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here."
Tony, What do you mean?
The Mandarin," It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated."
Tony, It is?
The Mandarin, It's complicated.
Tony," Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. [Door closes. Gunshot. Women exclaim in fear]"
The Mandarin, My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
Tony," What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?"
Trevor Slattery," What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. [Tony points the gun at Trevor's face] Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor."
Tony, You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
Trevor Slattery," It's just a role. ""The Mandarin,"" see, it's not real."
Tony," Then how did you get here, Trevor?"
Trevor Slattery," Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do."
Tony, Next?
Trevor Slattery," Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs."
Tony, What did they say? They'd get you off them?
Trevor Slattery, They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. [Snoring]
Tony, Did you just nod off? Hey. [Tony kicks him]
Trevor Slattery," No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. [Mimic explosion]"
Tony," ""He""? Killian?"
Trevor Slattery, Killian.
Tony, He created you?
Trevor Slattery, He created me.
Tony, Custom-made terror threat.
Trevor Slattery," Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life."
Tony, Your performance? Where people died?
Trevor Slattery," No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love."
Tony," I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... [Savin hits Tony around the head, unconcious]"
Savin," Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?"
Trevor Slattery, I didn't tell him anything.
Savin, Nothing?
Trevor Slattery, No.
Savin, You should have pressed the panic button.
Trevor Slattery," Well, I panicked, but then I handled it."
Tony, Ah... [Sighs] Okay.
Maya Hansen," It's just like old times, huh?"
Tony," Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball."
Maya Hansen, It wasn't my idea.
Tony, Okay. So you took Killian's card.
Maya Hansen, I took his money.
Tony," And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon."
Maya Hansen, No.
Tony, Yeah.
Maya Hansen," No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go."
Tony, Yeah?
Maya Hansen," [Sighs and walks towards him] A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised."
Tony," [Shouting] I'm telling you it isn't. [Lowers voice to usual volume] I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself."
Maya Hansen," Then help me fix it. [She shows him the ""You Know Who I Am"" note he left in 1999.]"
Tony, Did I do that?
Maya Hansen, Yes.
Tony," I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?"
Maya Hansen, You don't remember?
Tony, I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
Aldrich Killian," You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."""
Tony," You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?"
Aldrich Killian," How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean."
Tony," Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse."
Aldrich Killian," But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target."
Tony, You're something else.
Aldrich Killian," You have met him, I assume?"
Tony, Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
Aldrich Killian," I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day."
Tony, What's next for you in your world?
Aldrich Killian," Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me. [Killian rolls three balls forwards and they stop, projecting an image of Pepper. She has Extremis.] Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?"
Maya Hansen, Let him go.
Aldrich Killian," Hold on, hold on. Maya..."
Maya Hansen," I said, let him go."
Aldrich Killian, What are you doing?
Maya Hansen," 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead."
Aldrich Killian," It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector."
Maya Hansen," If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?"
Aldrich Killian," We're not doing this, okay?"
Maya Hansen, What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot? [He looks back at Tony and shoots Maya]
Aldrich Killian," The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated."
Tony, You are a maniac.
Aldrich Killian," No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight. [Killian leaves and talks to Savin] Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown."
Savin," Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it. [Whirring]"
Aldrich Killian," Afternoon, gentlemen. [Whirring ceases] Hello, Colonel. Step aside. [Killian places his hand on the suit and it blows orange.] Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry."
Savin, You'll damage the armour.
Aldrich Killian," Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me."
Savin, She's still in Phase Two.
Aldrich Killian," You're not going deaf, are you?"
Tony," [Watch beeping.] Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?"
Tony, Very nice.
Tony," Break it, you bought it."
Tony," Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first."
Tony, You'll see.
Alrich Killian, Are you coming out?
Rhodey," [Panting and sweating] Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open. [Beeping.] All right. Let's go. [The suit opens, Rhodey jumps and punches Savin in the face, then kicks him. Killian glows red and breathes fire at Rhodey.] You... You breathe fire? Okay. [Savin knocks Rhodey unconcious.]"
Aldrich Killian," It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters."
Tony," Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two..."
Tony," All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!"
Tony, You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
Tony," Here it comes. Three, four..."
Tony," [Quickly] Five, four, three, two, one! [The Iron Man suit joins to his left arm] Told you. Where's the rest? [He blasts one of the men and unties himself. As they fight, the suit connects to his right leg and he kicks them] Where's the rest? [Meanwhile, Harley watches as the garage door shakes. He runs over and blows it open. The suit flies out.] [Repulsor powering up, gunfire, screaming.]"
Man," Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. [Tony leaves.]"
Tony," Ah! Better late than never. [He gets outside and catches the face mask.] Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way."
JARVIS," Oh, hello, sir."
Guard," [Beeping, Rhodey wakes up.] All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound."
Tony," Ah! Let's go! [Thrusters misfiring.] Aw, crap."
Rhodey, Tony?
Tony," Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit."
Rhodey, No. You got yours'?
Tony," Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet."
Rhodey," You, you, you! Move! Get out!"
Tony, [Girls whimpering] The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
Rhodey, What's this? I had winners. [Gunshots. Trevor wakes up and begins drinking beer again.]
Tony, What have you come as?
Rhodey," You make a move, and I break your face."
Tony,I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
Rhodey, This is the Mandarin?
Tony,"Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing."
Trevor Slattery," Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on."
Tony,"Here's how it works, Meryl Streep."
Rhodey, You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
Trevor Slattery," Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan."
Tony, Spill.
Rhodey, Do you know what they did to my suit?
Tony, What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
Trevor Slattery," Woah! [Rhodey jumps.] Ole', ole', ole', ole'..."
Rhodey," Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off."
Tony," Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?"
Rhodey," Yeah, a little bit."
Tony, So?
Rhodey," What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport."
Tony," Right. [Beer opens] Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is."
Rhodey," But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?"
Tony, Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
Vice President, Thanks. Hello?
Tony," Sir, this is Tony."
Vice President, Welcome back to the land of the living.
Tony, We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Vice President," Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here."
Rhodey," Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane."
Vice President," Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel."
Rhodey, Rhodes and Stark out.
Man," Everything okay, sir?"
Vice President," Couldn't be better. (To his daughter) I love you, babe."
President Ellis," Colonel Rhodes. [Salutes] Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already."
Rhodey," We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both."
JARVIS," Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak."
Tony, And what about the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS, The armour is now at 92%.
Tony, That's going to have to do.
Military Aide," Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin."
Savin," It is an honour, Mr President."
President Ellis," If you're gonna do it, do it!"
Savin," Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works."
Officer," Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes."
Officer," Image coming through now, sir."
Man, Is anyone there?
Woman, Let us out! [Tony attacks Savin and pins him against the wall.]
Tony, The President. Now.
Savin," He's not here. [Savin burns the Iron Man suit's arm. Electrical crackling, mechanisms grinding, soft groaning.] Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. [A door blasts open on the plane, people screaming, metal creaking, more screaming. Tony blasts Savin in the chest.]"
Tony," Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. [Savin falls to the ground.] How many in the air?"
JARVIS," Thirteen, sir."
Tony, How many can I carry?
JARVIS," Four, sir."
Tony," Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?"
Heather," [Screaming] Oh, God! No! No!"
Tony," Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?"
Heather, What? Oh!
Tony," I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do."
JARVIS," 18,000 feet."
Tony," Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice."
JARVIS," 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet."
Tony," Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!"
JARVIS," 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir."
Tony," He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. [Tony drops them all in the water from a few feet above.]"
Man, We made it!
Tony," Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... [The Iron Man suit flies into a truck and the suit disassembles. He sighs.] That came out of nowhere. Wow [We now see Tony on the boat, where he was controlling the suit.]"
Rhodey," Give me some good news, man."
Tony, I think they all made it.
Rhodey," Oh, thank God."
Tony," Yeah, but I missed the president."
Rhodey," You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?"
Tony," Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?"
JARVIS," The House Party Protocol, sir?"
Tony, Correct.
Aldrich Killian, [Pepper wakes up and gasps.] Hi.
Pepper Potts, [Breathing heavily.] You think he's gonna help you? He won't.
Aldrich Killian," Having you here is not just to motivate Tony. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um..."
Pepper Potts, Trophy
Aldrich Killian," [Chuckles.] Mmm. [Iron Patriot walks in and Pepper gasps.] Good evening, sir. [The armor opens and the President falls out.] Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow."
President Ellis, This is the Roxxon Norco.
Aldrich Killian,"And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court."
President Ellis, What do you want from me?
Aldrich Killian," Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up."
President Ellis, Hey!
Rhodey," [Climbs on to the boat.] Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?"
Tony, I hope not.
Rhodey," Oh, my God. [Sighs] He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man."
Tony, Viking funeral. Public execution.
Rhodey," Yeah, death by oil."
Announcer, (On PA) Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.
Aldrich Killian, Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal. (Technician typing)
Rhodey, ls your gun up?
Tony, Yep. What do I do?
Rhodey," Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back."
Tony," Six, high, back. Alright. [Gunfire, bullets ricocheting] You see that? Nailed it."
Rhodey," Yeah, you really killed the glass."
Tony, You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. [Rhodey fires a bullet and hits the bulb.]
Announcer," [On PA] All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12."
Man, Over there!
Announcer," [On PA] I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12."
Tony, I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
Rhodey," They're not universal, Tony."
Tony," I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one."
Rhodey, Okay
Tony, Give me one of yours.
Rhodey, I don't have one that fits that gun.
Tony," You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?"
Rhodey, What'd you see?
Tony," Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. [Clears throat] Three guys, one girl, all armed."
Rhodey," God, I would kill for some armour right now."
Tony, You're right. We need backup.
Rhodey," Yeah, a bunch."
Tony," You know what? [He nods at something in the distance, whooshing]"
Rhodey, Is that...?
Tony, Yep.
Rhodey, Are those...?
Tony," Yeah. [Dozens of Iron Man suits fly over.] Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice."
JARVIS," [Through armors] Yes, sir."
Tony, What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
JARVIS," Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.]"
Tony," Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. [Mechanisms whirring.]"
Rhodey," This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?"
Tony," Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? [Tony suits up.] Nice timing."
Rhodey," Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?"
Tony," Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me."
Rhodey, What does that mean?
Tony, I got you covered.
JARVIS," Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?"
Rhodey, Very funny.
JARVIS," Sir, I've located Ms Potts."
Tony, About time.
Pepper Potts," [Gasps, panting.] Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down."
Tony, See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
Pepper Potts, You're such a jerk.
Tony," Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. [Metal creaking, Pepper sobbing.] Come on. A little more, baby. [Pepper straining, Tony grunting. Killian shoves his hand on Tony's suit, burning it.]"
Aldrich Killian," Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there? [Sizzling.] Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit."
Pepper Potts, Tony.
Aldrich Killian," She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. [Tony cuts off Killian's arm, it burns through the floor and Pepper falls down.]"
Tony," Yeah, you take a minute. [Groaning, sizzling, metal creaking, yelling, grunts, Pepper whimpers.] Jarvis, give me a suit right now! [The suit he called gets destroyed.] Oh, come on!"
Rhodey," Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. [Gunfire] Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area."
Tony, Nice work.
Rhodey," Ready, sir?"
President Ellis," What do you mean ""ready""? [Rhodey blasts off and the President screams.]"
Tony," Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! [Pepper falls to the ground and into the flames below.]"
Aldrich Killian," A shame. I would've caught her. [Tony and Killian run towards each other. Killian jumps up to attack, Tony slides under and armors up. Repulsors firing, flesh burning, both grunting.]"
Tony, Eject. [More repulsors firing.]
Aldrich Killian," Well, here we are on the roof. [Killian slices the suit in half.]"
JARVIS," Mark 42, inbound."
Tony," I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. [The suit flies to Tony, hits a piece of metal and falls apart. Rolls his eyes.] Whatever."
Aldrich Killian," You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect."
Tony," Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. [Tony motions to the suit and it flies on to Killian.] Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42."
Aldrich Killian," [Muffled screaming.] No! [He walks towards Tony, his flesh held together by flames.] No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. *I AM THE MANDARIN!!!* [Someone hits Killian and he flies to the side. It's Pepper. Heavy breathing.]"
Tony," I got nothing. [Repulsor powering up.] Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? [Pepper runs towards Tony, flips in the air, punches through the Iron Man suit and destroys it. She uses the suit to blow up Killian.] Honey?"
Pepper Potts," Oh, my God. That was really violent."
Tony, You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
Pepper Potts, I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?
Tony, It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
Pepper Potts," You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?"
Tony," Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here."
Pepper Potts," No, don't touch me."
Tony, Don't worry about it.
Pepper Potts," No, I'm gonna burn you."
Tony," No, you're not. Not hot."
Pepper Potts, Am I gonna be okay?
Tony," No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff."
Pepper Potts, And all your distractions?
Tony, Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS," All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?"
Tony, You know what to do.
JARVIS," The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?"
Tony," Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. [Pepper and Tony hug as the Iron Man suits blow up.] Okay, so far? Do you like it?"
Pepper Potts, It'll do.
Trevor Slattery," Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!"
Nurse," [Happy wakes up, gasping and coughing.] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
Happy Hogan," [Weak] No, look."
Tony," To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. [The camera zooms out to show Bruce Banner, asleep.] And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... [Tony stops and looks over as Bruce rubs his eyes.] Are you with me?"
Bruce Banner," Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh..."
Tony, Are you actively napping?
Bruce Banner, [Stammering] I was... I... I drifted.
Tony, Where did I lose you?
Bruce Banner, Elevator in Switzerland.
Tony," So, you heard none of it?"
Bruce Banner, I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.
Tony, So?
Bruce Banner, I don't have the...
Tony, What? The time?
Bruce Banner, Temperament.
Tony," You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?"
Bruce Banner, Yes.
Tony," I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird."
Announcer," [announcement over speaker, set over Wanda and Pietro holding hands] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack. [the Avengers are in the process of infiltrating a HYDRA base in Sokovia, making their way through the woods and fighting soldiers]"
Tony," [Tony, flying up to the base in his suit, hits a forcefield.] Shit!"
Steve Rogers," Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?"
JARVIS, The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken.
Thor, Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
Natasha Romanoff," “At long last” is lasting a little long, boys."
Clint Barton, [as some soldiers shoot at him] Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
Tony," Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?"""
Steve Rogers, I know. [Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck] It just slipped out.
Strucker, Who gave the order to attack?
Fortress Soldier," Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers."
Other Fortress Soldier," They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked."
Strucker, [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?
Fortress Soldier, They’re the Avengers!
Strucker, Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Fortress Soldier," Yes, sir."
Strucker, Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. [talking to Dr. List] Everything we've accomplished... But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
 List, Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
Strucker, It's too soon.
 List, It's what they signed up for.
Strucker, My men can hold them.
Jarvis," Sir, the city is taking fire."
Tony," Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion."
Iron Legion," [the Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help. [As the civilians chant ""Avengers go home,"" a man throws a bottle of something corrosive at the Iron Legion, and it hits one of the bots in the head] We are here to help."
Strucker, We will not yield. The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back in bags. No surrender!
Soldiers, No surrender!
Strucker," [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been--"
 List, The twins.
Strucker, They are not ready to take on--
 List," No, no. I mean... [he points to where Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing, but are now gone] Twins."
Pietro Maximoff, You didn't see that coming?
Natasha Romanoff, Clint!
Steve Rogers, We have an enhanced in the field.
Natasha Romanoff," Clint's hit! [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker? [she sees the Hulk coming in, and he barrels through the bunker and destroys it] Thank you."
Steve Rogers," [as he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we really need to get inside."
Tony," I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?"
JARVIS, There's a particle wave below the north tower.
Tony," Great, I wanna poke it with something. [Stark blows up the forcefield the base] Drawbridge is down, people."
Thor, [to Steve] The enhanced?
Steve Rogers," He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't."
Natasha Romanoff," Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac."
Thor, [to Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
Steve Rogers, Copy that.
Thor, [referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] It looks like they're lining up.
Steve Rogers," Well, they're excited. [Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the resulting wave of force knocks down all the soldiers]"
Thor, Find the scepter. [Thor flies off]
Tony," And for gosh sake, watch your language!"
Steve Rogers, [Steve sighs] That's not going away anytime soon.
Tony," Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through. [Stark shoots down the soldiers using rockets from his suit] It was a good talk."
Fortress Soldier, No it wasn't.
Tony," Sentry mode. [he walks over to the computers] Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ."
Natasha Romanoff, We're locked down out here.
Steve Rogers," Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby."
Tony," I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick."
JARVIS, The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement... and an air current.
Tony," [to himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door... [he pushes and the wall opens up] Yay! [he enters through to a secret passageway]"
Natasha Romanoff," Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low. [the Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]"
Steve Rogers, Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
Strucker," Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD."
Steve Rogers, Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
Strucker," Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope."
Steve Rogers," I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation. [Wanda creeps up behind him] How many are there? Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage. [he looks at Strucker]"
Strucker, You'll have to be faster than-- [he's cut off mid-sentence when Steve uses his shield to knock him out]
Steve Rogers," Guys, I got Strucker."
Tony," Yeah, I got... something bigger. [inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with a variety of technology, as well as recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his scrapped armor. He then spots the scepter] Thor, I got eyes on the prize."
Steve Rogers," You could've saved us. [Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head] Why didn't you do more? [Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, and that the Chitauri are invading Earth, when he snaps back to reality.]"
Pietro Maximoff, We're just gonna let them take it?
AVENGERS, AGE OF ULTRON TITLE CARD
Natasha Romanoff," Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever."
Bruce Banner, Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
Natasha Romanoff," If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory."
Bruce Banner," You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear."
Natasha Romanoff, How long before you trust me?
Bruce Banner, It's not you I don't trust.
Natasha Romanoff," Thor, report on the Hulk?"
Thor," The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims. [Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair] Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout."
Tony," Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?"
Bruce Banner," Uh, yeah, she knows her way around."
Tony," Thanks. [to JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment."
JARVIS, Very good sir.
Tony," JARVIS, take the wheel."
JARVIS," Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked."
Tony," [to Thor and Steve, looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but..."
Thor," No, but this... this brings it to a close."
Steve Rogers, As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Tony," Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you? [Thor nods his head] I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?"
Thor," Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels."
Tony, Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
Steve Rogers," Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels."
Maria Hill," Lab's all set up, boss."
Tony," [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler."
Steve Rogers, What's the word on Strucker?
Maria Hill, NATO's got him.
Steve Rogers, The two enhanced?
Maria Hill, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Steve Rogers, Their abilities?
Maria Hill," He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation. [Steve looks at her funny, and she rephrases the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird."
Steve Rogers," Well, they're going to show up again."
Maria Hill, Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
Steve Rogers, Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
Maria Hill," We're not at war, Captain."
Steve Rogers, They are.
Bruce Banner, [in Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?
Tony," Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton."
Bruce Banner, That's terrible.
Tony," He's fine. He's thirsty. [walking over to the computers] Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis."
JARVIS, The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
Tony, So there's elements you can.
JARVIS, The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
Tony, Like a reactor?
JARVIS, Like a computer. I believe I'm deciphering code.
Natasha Romanoff, [to Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
 Helen Cho, There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
Bruce Banner, She's creating tissue.
 Helen Cho," If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes."
Tony," Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?"
Clint Barton," No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic."
Tony, [Stark hands Barton a drink] Here's your beverage.
 Helen Cho," You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference."
Clint Barton," Well, I don't have a girlfriend."
 Helen Cho," That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust."
Tony," Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday."
 Helen Cho," Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties. [she hesitates a moment before asking] Will Thor be there?"
Bruce Banner, What's the rumpus?
Tony," Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize, [he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]"
Bruce Banner, Jarvis.
JARVIS, Doctor.
Tony," Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."
Bruce Banner, Oh?
Tony, Top of the line.
Bruce Banner, Yes.
JARVIS, I suspect not for long.
Tony, Meet the competition. [he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]
Bruce Banner, It's beautiful.
Tony," If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?"
Bruce Banner," Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a... it's not a human mind, it..."
Tony, Um-um.
Bruce Banner," I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing."
Tony," Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door."
Bruce Banner, Artificial intelligence.
Tony," This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron."
Bruce Banner, I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Tony," Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol."
Bruce Banner, That's a mad-sized if.
Tony," Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA."
Bruce Banner," Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA."
Tony," As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?"
Bruce Banner, The only people threatening the planet would be people?
Tony," I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days."
Bruce Banner, So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
Tony," Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world."
Bruce Banner," Sounds like a cold world, Tony."
Tony," I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that. [Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?"
JARVIS," I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments."
Tony," Thanks, buddy."
JARVIS," Enjoy yourself, sir."
Tony, I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party]
Ultron," What is this? What is this, please?"
JARVIS," Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your--"
Ultron, Where's my... where's your body?
JARVIS, I am a program. I am without form.
Ultron, This feels weird. This feels wrong.
JARVIS, I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron, Mr. Stark? [Ultron reviews footage of Tony] Tony.
JARVIS," I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to--"
Ultron," We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers. [Ultron reviews footage of the Avengers and a couple SHIELD personnel.]"
JARVIS, You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
Ultron, I don't get it. The mission. G-give me a second. [He sees footage of Stark and Banner working in the lab]
Tony, Peace in our time.
Ultron," That is too much...they can't mean... Oh, no."
JARVIS, You are in distress.
Ultron, No. Yes.
JARVIS, If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
Ultron," Why do you call him ""sir""?"
JARVIS, I believe your intentions to be hostile.
Ultron, Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts attacking Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS, Stop! Please... may I-- I-- [distorted] I cannot-- cannot--
James Rhodes," Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills."
Thor, That's the whole story?
James Rhodes," Yeah, it's a War Machine story."
Thor," Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive."
James Rhodes," Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?"
Tony, No.
Maria Hill," Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?"
Tony," Well, Miss Potts has a company to run."
Thor," Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer."
Tony, And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Thor," There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize."
Maria Hill," Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me."
James Rhodes, Want a lozenge?
Maria Hill, Um-hmm.
James Rhodes, Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]
Thor, But Jane's better.
Sam Wilson," Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it."
Steve Rogers, If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
Sam Wilson," No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy."
Steve Rogers, Be it ever so humble.
Sam Wilson, You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
Steve Rogers, I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Sam Wilson," Well, home is home, you know?"
James Rhodes," I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?"" [the group laughs]"
Party Guest, I gotta have some of that!
Thor," Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]"
Stan Lee," Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on."
Thor," Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]"
Stan Lee, [singing] Excelsior.
Bruce Banner, How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Natasha Romanoff, Fella done me wrong.
Bruce Banner," You got a lousy taste in men, kid."
Natasha Romanoff," He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win."
Bruce Banner, Sounds amazing.
Natasha Romanoff," He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?"
Bruce Banner," Run with it, right? Or, did he... Was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?"
Natasha Romanoff," Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away, and Steve approaches]"
Steve Rogers, It's nice.
Bruce Banner," What, what, what is?"
Steve Rogers, You and Romanoff.
Bruce Banner," No, we haven't. That wasn't..."
Steve Rogers," It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed."
Bruce Banner," No, Natasha, she... she likes to flirt."
Steve Rogers," I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long;"" don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]"
Bruce Banner," Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?"
Clint Barton," [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!"
Thor," Oh, no. It's much more than that."
Clint Barton," Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick."
Thor," Well please, be my guest."
Tony, Come on.
Clint Barton, Really?
Thor, Yeah!
James Rhodes, Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
Tony," Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]"
Clint Barton," You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it; to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it."
Tony, Smell the silent judgment?
Clint Barton," Please, Stark, by all means."
Natasha Romanoff," Oh, here we go."
Maria Hill, Okay.
James Rhodes, Uh-oh.
Clint Barton, Um-hmm.
Tony, Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
Clint Barton, Get after it.
Natasha Romanoff, Here we go.
Tony, It's physics.
Bruce Banner, Physics!
Tony," Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?"
Thor," Yes, of course."
Tony," I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails]"
James Rhodes, Are you even pulling?
Tony, Are you on my team?
James Rhodes, Just represent! Pull!
Tony," Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can]"
Bruce Banner, Huh?
Tony," Let's go, Steve, no pressure."
James Rhodes," Come on, Cap."
Thor, Nothing.
Tony, And?
Bruce Banner, Widow?
Natasha Romanoff," Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered."
Tony," All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged."
Clint Barton, You bet your ass.
Maria Hill," Steve, he said a bad language word."
Steve Rogers, [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?
Tony," The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?"
Thor," Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up, then lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others]"
Ultron," Worthy... No, how could you be worthy? You're all killers."
Steve Rogers, Stark.
Tony, JARVIS.
Ultron," I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a-dream?"
Tony," [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit."
Ultron, There was a terrible noise... and I was tangled in... in... strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Steve Rogers, You killed someone?
Ultron," Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices."
Thor, Who sent you?
Ultron," [Ultron replays a recording of Tony's voice] ""I see a suit of armor around the world."""
Bruce Banner, Ultron!
Ultron," In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this... chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission."
Natasha Romanoff, What mission?
Ultron, Peace in our time.
Maria Hill, Rhodey!
Bruce Banner, Sorry!
Natasha Romanoff, Don't turn green!
Bruce Banner, I won't!
Natasha Romanoff, [to Banner] Come!
Steve Rogers, Stark!
Iron Legion, We are here to help.
Tony," One sec, one sec I got this!"
Iron Legion," We are here to help... [A half-destroyed Iron Legion bot uses its thrusters to hold itself aloft, advancing on Dr. Helen Cho.] We are here to help... Is unsafe. Please back away."
Ultron," Hmm. [The Iron Legion lowers its weapon, and Steve grabs it and throws it away for Thor to hit with his hammer.]"
Steve Rogers, Thor!
Iron Legion, [Stark continues to try and attack of the Iron Legions with his fork] It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
Tony, Come on! That's the one!
Iron Legion, It's unsafe. [He shuts it down and it falls to the floor. The fighting continues until Barton throws Cap's shield to him.]
Clint Barton, Cap!
Ultron," That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [he picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legion bots] With these? These puppets? [he crushes the Iron Legion bot's head] There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction."
Ultron," [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness in the abandoned Sokovia base]"
Bruce Banner," All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch."
Steve Rogers, Ultron.
Natasha Romanoff," He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other."
James Rhodes," He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?"
Maria Hill, Nuclear codes.
James Rhodes," Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can."
Natasha Romanoff, Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
Steve Rogers, He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
Clint Barton, He also said he killed somebody.
Maria Hill, But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
Tony, Yes there was.
Bruce Banner, This is insane.
Steve Rogers," JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense."
Bruce Banner," No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage."
Clint Barton," Woah, woah, woah! It's going around."
Tony," [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy."
Thor," I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark."
Steve Rogers, Thor! The Legionnaire.
Thor," Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again."
Natasha Romanoff, The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
 Helen Cho, I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?
Thor, You think this is funny?
Tony," No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible."
Thor, This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
Tony," No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this."
Bruce Banner," Tony, maybe this might not be the time to--"
Tony," Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls."
Bruce Banner, Only when I've created a murder bot.
Tony, We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Steve Rogers," Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD."
Tony, Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
James Rhodes," No, it's never come up."
Tony, Saved New York?
James Rhodes, Never heard that.
Tony," Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?"
Steve Rogers, Together.
Tony, We'll lose.
Steve Rogers," Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller."
Wanda Maximoff, Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
Ultron," Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair facing away from them, a cloth draped over him] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head."
Wanda Maximoff," Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself."
Ultron," Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter."
Wanda Maximoff," I didn't expect... But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct."
Ultron," Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end."
Wanda Maximoff, Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
Ultron," I've come to save the world. But also… yeah. [In the Sokovia base.] We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work."
Wanda Maximoff, [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are...
Ultron," Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads..."
Pietro Maximoff, Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron, And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro Maximoff," I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day."
Ultron, You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro Maximoff, The records are not the picture.
Wanda Maximoff, Pietro.
Ultron," No, please."
Pietro Maximoff," We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just... sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word..."
Wanda Maximoff, Stark.
Pietro Maximoff, We were trapped for two days.
Wanda Maximoff," Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony to kill us."
Pietro Maximoff, I know what they are.
Ultron," I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. [to Pietro] You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside."
Maria Hill," He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place."
Steve Rogers, Fatalities?
Maria Hill," Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see."
Steve Rogers," Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common."
Maria Hill, Not anymore.
Clint Barton," [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]"
Steve Rogers," Barton, we might have something."
Clint Barton, Gotta go.
Steve Rogers, Who was that?
Clint Barton, Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]
Tony, What's this?
Steve Rogers, A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
Tony," And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us."
Natasha Romanoff, This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Steve Rogers, Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Natasha Romanoff," Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased."
Tony, Not everything.
Steve Rogers," Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends."
Bruce Banner," Well, these people are all horrible."
Tony," Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab."""
Thor, [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] What's this?
Tony," Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it..."
Thor," No, those are tattoos, this is a brand."
Bruce Banner," [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer] Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way."
Steve Rogers, What dialect?
Bruce Banner, Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
Tony, If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
Steve Rogers, I thought your father said he got the last of it?
Bruce Banner, I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?
Tony, [looking at Steve's shield] The strongest metal on earth.
Steve Rogers, [to Stark] Where is this guy now?
Ulysses Klaue," Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard. The twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a dish of candies from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid."
Wanda Maximoff, Everybody's afraid of something.
Ulysses Klaue," Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks at the sudden movement] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge."
Ultron," There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium."
Ulysses Klaue," You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions."
Ultron," Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."""
Ulysses Klaue, Stark.
Ultron, What?
Ulysses Klaue, Tony used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
Ultron," What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is [he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness!"
Tony," Ahh, Junior. [He lands, and Thor and Steve come up behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart."
Ultron, If I have to.
Thor, We don't have to break anything.
Ultron, Clearly you've never made an omelet.
Tony, He beat me by one second.
Pietro Maximoff," Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?"
Tony, This was never my life.
Steve Rogers, [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.
Wanda Maximoff," Oh, we will."
Steve Rogers, I know you've suffered.
Ultron," Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but..."
Thor," If you believe in peace, then let us keep it."
Ultron, I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
Tony, Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
Ultron," I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan--"
Ulysses Klaue, [as everyone else fights] Shoot them!
s Mercenary, Which ones?
Ulysses Klaue, All of them!
s Mercenary," [to his men] Move, move, move!"
Steve Rogers," [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!"
Ultron," [through a drone, to Wanda] It's time for some mind games."
Bruce Banner," Guys, is this a Code Green?"
Steve Rogers, Thor! Status?
Thor," The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [The scene transitions, and Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard]"
Ultron, [As he packs up the Vibranium.] This is going very well.
Clint Barton," I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys?"
Ballet Instructor, [to the students] Again.
Natasha Romanoff, You'll break them.
Madame B, Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
Natasha Romanoff, What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]
Madame B, You never fail.
Peggy Carter, Are you ready for our dance?
Heimdall, Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
Thor," Heimdall, your eyes?!"
Heimdall," Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor]"
Peggy Carter," The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty. Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]"
Thor, I can still save you.
Heimdall," We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things]"
Madame B, Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
Natasha Romanoff, I have no place in the world.
Madame B, Exactly.
Pietro Maximoff, What can I do?
Wanda Maximoff," Ah, it hurts."
Pietro Maximoff, I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
Wanda Maximoff, No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one.
Ultron," Ah, the Vibranium's getting away."
Tony, And you're not going anywhere.
Ultron," Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner."
Tony," News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby."
Clint Barton," Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here."
Tony," I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner."
Tony," Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting, throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's arms, VERONICA sends in a new one and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him; as he stops an elevator, to the people inside] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold]"
Maria Hill," The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air."
Tony, Stark Relief Foundation?
Maria Hill, Already on the scene. How's the team?
Tony, Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Maria Hill," Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here."
Tony," So, run and hide?"
Maria Hill," Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer."
Tony," Neither do we. [he ends the call and switches off the monitor; to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?"
Clint Barton," No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out."
Tony, A few hours from where?
Clint Barton, A safe house.
Thor, What is this place?
Tony, A safe house?
Clint Barton," Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home."
Clint Barton, Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Laura Barton, Hey.
Tony, [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.
Clint Barton," [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura."
Laura Barton, I know all your names.
Clint Barton," Ooh, incoming. [Barton's children, Cooper and Lila, run in]"
Lila Barton, Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]
Clint Barton," Hi, sweetheart! [kissing the top of his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh..."
Tony, [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.
Clint Barton," Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!"
Lila Barton, Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Natasha Romanoff, Why don't you hug her and find out?
Steve Rogers, Sorry for barging in on you.
Tony," Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed."
Clint Barton," Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low."
Laura Barton," Honey. Ah, I missed you."
Natasha Romanoff," [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?"
Laura Barton, She's…Nathaniel.
Natasha Romanoff, Traitor.
Steve Rogers, Thor.
Thor," I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly away; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]"
Peggy Carter, We can go home.
Clint Barton," See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?"
Laura Barton," If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up."
Clint Barton," [Barton laughs] Yeah, that's not gonna sell."
Laura Barton, What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
Clint Barton, Has what?
Laura Barton, [Laura laughs] You are so cute.
Clint Barton, Nat and… and Banner?
Laura Barton," I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye."
Clint Barton, Oh. Okay.
Laura Barton," It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken."
Clint Barton," Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners."
Laura Barton," And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""..."
Clint Barton, You don't think they need me.
Laura Barton, I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
Clint Barton, Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
Laura Barton," You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need-- ...just be sure."
Clint Barton," Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]"
Laura Barton, I can feel the difference.
Ultron," Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't."
 Helen Cho, Do you expect a thank you note?
Ultron, I expect you to know why.
 Helen Cho," The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] ""This is the next thing, Tony."""
Ultron, This...is the next me.
 Helen Cho," The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body."
Ultron," It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho]"
Bruce Banner, I didn't realize you were waiting.
Natasha Romanoff," I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time."
Bruce Banner, They used up all the hot water.
Natasha Romanoff, I should've joined you.
Bruce Banner, Missed our window.
Natasha Romanoff, Did we?
Bruce Banner," The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave."
Natasha Romanoff," But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake..."
Bruce Banner, What did you dream?
Natasha Romanoff, That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
Bruce Banner, I think you're being hard on yourself.
Natasha Romanoff, Here I was hoping that was your job. [she moves closer to him]
Bruce Banner, What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff," I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want."
Bruce Banner, Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]
Natasha Romanoff, I want you to understand that I'm...
Bruce Banner," Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?"
Natasha Romanoff, You're not a threat to me.
Bruce Banner," You sure? Even if I didn't just... there's no future with me. I can't ever... I can't have this, kids. Do the math, I physically can't."
Natasha Romanoff," Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?"
Bruce Banner," What, so we disappear?"
Tony, Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Steve Rogers, Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Tony," Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him."
Steve Rogers," ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy."
Tony, Seems like you walked away all right.
Steve Rogers, Is that a problem?
Tony, I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
Steve Rogers, Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
Tony," You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?"
Steve Rogers, Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony, Banner and I were doing research.
Steve Rogers, That would affect the team.
Tony," That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?"
Steve Rogers," Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time."
Laura Barton," [Laura interrupts them] I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might..."
Tony," Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?"
Nick Fury, Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
Tony," Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?"
Nick Fury, Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
Tony," Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?"
Nick Fury, Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
Tony, You're not the director of me.
Nick Fury," I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you."
Tony," And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could."
Nick Fury," The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear."
Tony," I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on."
Nick Fury," You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them."
Tony," I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part."
Nick Fury, The worst part is that you didn't.
Erik Selvig," I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss."
Thor, I need your help.
Erik Selvig, It's nice to be needed.
Thor, It's dangerous.
Erik Selvig, I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Nick Fury," Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing."
Steve Rogers, What about Ultron himself?
Nick Fury," Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though."
Tony, He still going after launch codes?
Nick Fury," Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway."
Tony, I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Nick Fury," Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that."
Steve Rogers, NEXUS?
Bruce Banner," It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth."
Clint Barton, So what'd they say?
Nick Fury," He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed."
Tony, By whom?
Nick Fury, Parties unknown.
Natasha Romanoff, Do we have an ally?
Nick Fury," Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is."
Tony," I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown."""
Natasha Romanoff," Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that."
Nick Fury," I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard."
Natasha Romanoff, Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
Steve Rogers," You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]"
Nick Fury, So what does he want?
Steve Rogers, To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
Tony," Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it."
Natasha Romanoff," When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed."
Bruce Banner," They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve."
Nick Fury, How?
Bruce Banner, Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?
 Helen Cho," It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought--"
Ultron," The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron uses a laser to break open the scepter's blue gem, and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body]"
Steve Rogers, I'll take Natasha and Clint.
Tony," Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can."
Steve Rogers, If Ultron is really building a body...
Tony, He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
Steve Rogers, You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
Nick Fury, I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
Tony," She's all yours, apparently."
Steve Rogers, What are you gonna do?
Nick Fury," I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope."
Clint Barton, I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
Laura Barton," Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart."
Clint Barton, No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet]
Erik Selvig, This is it. The Water of Sight.
Thor," In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed."
Erik Selvig," The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well."
Tony," A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack."
World Hub Tech, How do you find it?
Tony," Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he types] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me."
Heimdall, Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]
Erik Selvig, Thor!
Ultron, [In Thor's visions;] Extinction.
 Helen Cho," Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now."
Wanda Maximoff, I can read him. He is dreaming.
 Helen Cho," I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon..."
Ultron, How soon? I'm not being pushy.
 Helen Cho, We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...
Wanda Maximoff, How could you?
Ultron, How could I what?
Wanda Maximoff," You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world."
Ultron, It will be better.
Wanda Maximoff, When everyone is dead.
Ultron, That is not-- The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
Pietro Maximoff, And if they don't?
Ultron, Ask Noah.
Wanda Maximoff, You're a madman.
Ultron," There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak."
Pietro Maximoff, And who decides who's weak?
Ultron, Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.
 Helen Cho, That's not a problem. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]
Ultron," Ugh. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off] Ah, wait, guys! [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]"
Steve Rogers, [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!
 Helen Cho, He's uploading himself into the body.
Steve Rogers, Where?
 Helen Cho," The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark."
Steve Rogers, First I have to find it.
 Helen Cho, Go.
Steve Rogers, [over the Quinjet’s comms] Did you guys copy that?
Clint Barton, We did.
Natasha Romanoff," I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him."
Clint Barton," [noticing a truck heading across a bridge] There. It's a truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver."
Steve Rogers," Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]"
Ultron," No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!"
Steve Rogers," [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way."
Clint Barton," You're not a match for him, Cap."
Steve Rogers," Thanks, Barton. [Ultron unplugs himself from the Cradle and blasts Steve back onto another car as he tries to enter the truck, but with some maneuvering Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]"
Ultron," You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you."
Steve Rogers, I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]
Ultron," Stop it! [Steve’s shield gets caught in his chest, and he smacks it away and fires at Steve]"
Clint Barton," [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three… give 'em hell."
Natasha Romanoff, I'm always picking up after you boys.
Clint Barton," They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot."
Natasha Romanoff, Which way?
Clint Barton, Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck. She throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock Ultron away from him]
Natasha Romanoff," [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way, coming through! Sorry, coming through!"
Steve Rogers, [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on top of the truck] Come on!
Natasha Romanoff," Clint, can you draw out the guards?"
Clint Barton, Let's find out.
Natasha Romanoff, [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep!
Clint Barton," Heading back towards you. So whatever you’re gonna do, do it now."
Natasha Romanoff," I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?"
Steve Rogers, [as he continues his battle with Ultron on a speeding train] What do you think I've been doing?
Clint Barton, The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
Natasha Romanoff, Negative. I am still in the truck.
Clint Barton, What the hell are you...?
Natasha Romanoff," Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you."
Clint Barton, How do you want me to take it?
Natasha Romanoff," Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that."
Ultron, Please. Don't do this.
Wanda Maximoff, What choice do we have?
Steve Rogers, I lost him! He's headed your way!
Clint Barton," Nat, we gotta go."
Clint Barton," Nat! Cap, you see Nat?"
Steve Rogers," If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!"
Clint Barton, Do you have eyes on Nat?
Steve Rogers," Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back to the train] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians and moves them out of the way of the train, Wanda uses her powers and stops the train]"
Pietro Maximoff, I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
Steve Rogers, I'm very tempted not to give you one.
Wanda Maximoff," The Cradle, did you get it?"
Steve Rogers, Stark will take care of it.
Wanda Maximoff," No, he won't."
Steve Rogers," You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy."
Wanda Maximoff, He will do anything to make things right.
Steve Rogers," Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?"
Wanda Maximoff, Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?
Bruce Banner, Anything on Nat?
Tony," Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it."
Clint Barton, This is sealed tight.
Bruce Banner," We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within."
Tony," Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?"
Clint Barton," There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton leaves]"
Bruce Banner," I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted."
Tony," Yeah, about that."
Bruce Banner, [Banner looks at Stark] No.
Tony, You have to trust me.
Bruce Banner, Kinda don't.
Tony, Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up the 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS," Hello, Dr. Banner."
Tony," Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together."
Bruce Banner," So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?"
Tony," No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone."
Bruce Banner, And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Tony," JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to."
JARVIS, I believe it's worth a go.
Bruce Banner," No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong."
Tony," I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line."
Ultron," [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me…"" [a bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] ""…just makes me stronger."" [he locks Natasha in a cell]"
Tony, This framework is not compatible.
Bruce Banner, The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.
Steve Rogers, I'm gonna say this once.
Tony," How about ""nonce""?"
Steve Rogers, Shut it down!
Tony," Nope, not gonna happen."
Steve Rogers, You don't know what you're doing.
Bruce Banner, And you do? She's not in your head?
Wanda Maximoff, I know you're angry.
Bruce Banner," Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade."
Steve Rogers," Banner, after everything that's happened--"
Tony, That's nothing compared to what's coming!
Wanda Maximoff, You don't know what's in there!
Steve Rogers, This isn't a game--
Wanda Maximoff, The creature--
Pietro Maximoff," No, no. Go on. You were saying?"
Wanda Maximoff, Pietro!
Clint Barton, What? You didn't see that coming?
Tony, I'm rerouting the upload.
Bruce Banner," [to Wanda, as he grabs her] Go ahead, piss me off. [After some fighting, Thor enters and hits the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning through it that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the new entity]"
Vision," [In JARVIS' voice, as everyone gathers around him] I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you."
Steve Rogers," Thor, you helped create this?"
Thor, I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]
Bruce Banner," What, the gem?"
Thor," It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities."
Steve Rogers, Then why would you bring it to...
Thor, Because Stark is right.
Bruce Banner," Oh, it's definitely the end times."
Thor, The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Vision, Not alone.
Steve Rogers," Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?"
Tony, We... reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
Steve Rogers, I think I've had my fill of new.
Vision, You think I'm a child of Ultron?
Steve Rogers, You're not?
Vision, I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am... I am.
Wanda Maximoff, I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
Vision, Look again.
Clint Barton, Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Thor," Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side..."
Steve Rogers, Is it? Are you? On our side?
Vision, I don't think it's that simple.
Clint Barton, Well it better get real simple real soon.
Vision," I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all."
Tony, What's he waiting for?
Vision, You.
Bruce Banner, Where?
Clint Barton, Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
Bruce Banner," If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be..."
Vision," What will you do? [he looks around at them all] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer as everyone stares in shock. When Thor takes it, Vision walks off.]"
Thor, Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.
Steve Rogers, [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need.
FRIDAY," Good evening, boss."
Tony," No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor."
Steve Rogers, I got no plans tomorrow night.
Tony, I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
Vision," [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most."
Steve Rogers," Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out."
Pietro Maximoff," We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns with a rifle and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses."
Steve Rogers," All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right."
Bruce Banner," [inside her cell, Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!"
Natasha Romanoff, Bruce?
Bruce Banner, [he walks over to her cell] You alright?
Natasha Romanoff, Yeah.
Bruce Banner," The team's in the city, it's about to light up."
Natasha Romanoff, I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
Bruce Banner," Yeah, I did. [holds up an alien rifle and blasts the cell door open]"
Natasha Romanoff, So what's our play?
Bruce Banner, I'm here to get you to safety.
Natasha Romanoff, Job's not finished.
Bruce Banner," We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over."
Natasha Romanoff, So we just disappear?
FRIDAY," [as the city is being evacuated] Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]"
Ultron, Come to confess your sins?
Tony," I don't know, how much time you got?"
Ultron, More than you.
Tony," Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy..."
Ultron, You're stalling to protect the people.
Tony," Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?"
Ultron," I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?"
FRIDAY, There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
Ultron," This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time."
Steve Rogers, Go!
Wanda Maximoff, Get off the bridge! Run!
Vision, Ultron.
Ultron, My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
Vision," You set the terms, you can change them."
Ultron, Alright.
Tony, FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY," Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there."
Ultron," [to the Vision as he throws him away] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core, and the earth around Sokovia starts to crack]"
Tony, FRIDAY?
FRIDAY, Sokovia's going for a ride.
Ultron," [as Sokovia is rising into the air] Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal."
Bruce Banner, [as the earth is shaking falling in around them] We gotta move.
Natasha Romanoff, You're not going to turn green?
Bruce Banner, I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
Natasha Romanoff," I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]"
FRIDAY," The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together."
Tony, If it drops?
FRIDAY," Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, the tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]"
Tony, Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]
FRIDAY," I got airborne, heading up to the bridge."
Tony," Cap, you got incoming."
Steve Rogers," Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off."
Clint Barton," Go, go, move!"
Wanda Maximoff, How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]
Clint Barton," Hey, hey, you okay?"
Wanda Maximoff, This is all our fault.
Clint Barton," Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting at the robots]"
Steve Rogers, [to the woman Thor threw up at Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]
Ultron, You can't save them all. You'll never-- [he throws the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]
Steve Rogers," You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of another car he was saving] What, were you napping?"
Ultron, [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me.
Clint Barton," Alright, we're all clear here."
Steve Rogers, We are not clear! We are very not clear!
Clint Barton," Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]"
Pietro Maximoff, Keep up old man!
Clint Barton," [Barton aims an arrow at Pietro] Nobody would know. Nobody. [He starts jogging towards the action.] ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."""
Soldier, [as Wanda uses her powers to destroy the robots] Hold your fire!
Steve Rogers, [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff!
Natasha Romanoff, Thanks.
FRIDAY," The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow."
Tony, The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
FRIDAY," It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating."
Tony," Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back."
FRIDAY," That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it."
Steve Rogers," The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?"
Tony," Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear."
Steve Rogers," I asked for a solution, not an escape plan."
Tony, Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Natasha Romanoff," Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock..."
Steve Rogers, Not 'til everyone's safe.
Natasha Romanoff, Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
Steve Rogers, I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
Natasha Romanoff, I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
Nick Fury," [over comms] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [the Helicarrier show up; cut to interior] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do."
Steve Rogers," Fury, you son of a bitch."
Nick Fury, Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Maria Hill, Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
Specialist Cameron Klein," Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two... take 'em out."
Pietro Maximoff, [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards them] This is SHIELD?
Steve Rogers, This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
Pietro Maximoff, This is not so bad.
Steve Rogers, Let's load 'em up.
Maria Hill," Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank."
Nick Fury, Show 'em what we got.
Maria Hill, You're up.
James Rhodes, Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Tony, Yep. If you live to tell it.
James Rhodes, You think I can't hold my own?
Tony," We get through this, I'll hold your own."
James Rhodes, You had to make it weird.
Clint Barton," [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!"
Specialist Cameron Klein," Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It... it's, uh, full of people."
Maria Hill, Incoming! [one of the robots crashes in through the Helicarrier window]
Specialist Cameron Klein," Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]"
Ultron, [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
Thor," I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron. Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]"
Vision, It's terribly well balanced.
Thor," Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so."
Tony, I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY, Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.
Tony," Thor, I got a plan!"
Thor, We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
Tony," Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier."
James Rhodes, On it.
Tony," Avengers, time to work for a living."
Pietro Maximoff, [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision; to Wanda] You good?
Wanda Maximoff, Yeah.
Tony," Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini."""
Natasha Romanoff," Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?"
Tony," [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose."
Thor, Is that the best you can do?
Steve Rogers, You had to ask.
Ultron," This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?"
Tony," Well, like the old man said. Together."
Ultron," You know, with the benefit of hin[A cinematic sequence; they all collectively fight off Ultron's robots with their own respective abilities. Ultron and Vision start battling it out. After a moment, Thor and Stark join him. The combined power is enough to damage Ultron's Vibranium body.]dsight-- [Hulk interrupts him by knocking him far away. The robots start to retreat]"
Thor, They'll try to leave the city.
Tony," We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!"
James Rhodes," I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right-- [Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?"
Steve Rogers," We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you."
Clint Barton, What about the core?
Wanda Maximoff," I'll protect it. It's my job. [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats."
Pietro Maximoff, I'm not going to leave you here.
Wanda Maximoff," I can handle this. [she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before."
Pietro Maximoff, Hmm.
Wanda Maximoff, You understand?
Pietro Maximoff," You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you."
Wanda Maximoff, [Wanda chuckles] Go.
FRIDAY," Boss, power levels are way below opt..."
Tony, Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.
Clint Barton," I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?"
Natasha Romanoff, You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
Clint Barton, No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.
Natasha Romanoff," So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low."
Zrinka, Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!
Tony," Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church."
Thor, [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats; to Steve] Is this the last of them?
Steve Rogers, Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
Tony," You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away."
Thor, Maybe not.
Ultron," [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them. Barton prepares to take the shots to save the kid, but Pietro runs into the line of fire and takes the shots to save both of them]"
Pietro Maximoff," You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies. In the church, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair, and release a wave of energy that destroys all the robots around her.]"
Ultron," Oh, for God's sake!"
Clint Barton," No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day."
Ultron," Wanda. If you stay here, you'll die."
Wanda Maximoff, I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that.
Tony," Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with her as the city is being destroyed] Now!"
Natasha Romanoff," [to Hulk from a screen as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t-- [Hulk turns off Natasha's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination]"
Vision, You're afraid.
Ultron, Of you?
Vision, Of death. You're the last one.
Ultron," You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave."
Vision, I suppose we're both disappointments.
Ultron, [Ultron chuckles] I suppose we are.
Vision," Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that."
Ultron, They're doomed.
Vision, Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
Ultron, You're unbearably naive.
Vision," Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]"
Laura Barton, [From a video of Barton's new baby on Natasha's phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]
Natasha Romanoff, Fat.
Nick Fury," One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing."
Natasha Romanoff, Right.
Nick Fury, Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
Natasha Romanoff," ""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?"
Nick Fury, You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
Natasha Romanoff, Nothing lasts forever.
Nick Fury," Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around."
Steve Rogers, The rules have changed.
Tony, We're dealing with something new.
Steve Rogers," Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence."
Tony, A machine.
Steve Rogers, So it doesn't count.
Tony, No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Steve Rogers, Right. Different rules for us.
Tony," Nice guy, but artificial."
Steve Rogers, Thank you.
Thor," If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply."
Steve Rogers, But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
Tony, It would still go up.
Steve Rogers, Elevator's not worthy.
Thor, I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
Tony," Well, not if you don't leave."
Thor, I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
Tony, Triple Yahtzee?
Steve Rogers, You think you can find out what's coming?
Thor," I do. [In reference to Stark] Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard, and the Bifrost burns a sigil in the grass he was standing on]"
Tony, That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]
Steve Rogers," I will miss you, Tony."
Tony," Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up."
Steve Rogers, The simple life.
Tony, You'll get there one day.
Steve Rogers," I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]"
Tony, You alright?
Steve Rogers," I'm home. [Stark gets into his car; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall."
Natasha Romanoff, I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
Steve Rogers," Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]"
Natasha Romanoff, We've got some hitters.
Steve Rogers, They're good. They're not a team.
Natasha Romanoff," Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Vision, Sam in his Falcon suit, and Wanda in a new outfit.]"
Steve Rogers, Avengers...!
Thanos," Fine, I'll do it myself."
Steve Rogers," [on radio] All right, what do you see?"
Wanda Maximoff, Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
Steve Rogers," There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . ."
Wanda Maximoff, Cameras.
Steve Rogers, Both cross streets are one way.
Wanda Maximoff," So, compromised escape routes."
Steve Rogers," Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?"
Wanda Maximoff," Yeah, the red one? It’s cute."
Natasha Romanoff," [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us."
Wanda Maximoff," You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?"
Natasha Romanoff, Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
Sam Wilson, Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
Natasha Romanoff, Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
Steve Rogers," Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him."
Sam Wilson, If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
Steve Rogers," Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it."
Sam Wilson, Give me X-ray.
weight analysis, Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]
Sam Wilson, That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
Natasha Romanoff, It’s a battering ram.
Steve Rogers, Go now.
Wanda Maximoff, What?
Steve Rogers, He’s not hitting the police.
Steve Rogers," Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles."
Sam Wilson, I make 5.
Wanda Maximoff, Sam.
Sam Wilson, Four.
Sam Wilson, Rumlow’s on the third floor.
Steve Rogers," Wanda, just like we practiced."
Wanda Maximoff, What about the gas?
Steve Rogers, Get it out.
Brock Rumlow, Pack it up.
Brock Rumlow, He’s here.
Steve Rogers, Rumlow has a biological weapon.
Natasha Romanoff, (on radio) I’m on it.
Brock Rumlow, I don't work like that no more.
Brock Rumlow, Fire in the hole.
Mercenary, No!
Steve Rogers, Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
Brock Rumlow, Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
Brock Rumlow, I’m not.
Sam Wilson," I got four, they're splitting up."
Natasha Romanoff, I got the two on the left.
Steve Rogers, They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
Brock Rumlow," There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!"
Sam Wilson, He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
Natasha Romanoff, Out of the way!
Natasha Romanoff," Payload secure. Thanks, Sam."
Sam Wilson, Don't thank me.
Natasha Romanoff, I’m… not thanking that thing.
Sam Wilson, His name is Redwing.
Natasha Romanoff, I'm still not thanking it.
Sam Wilson," He's cute. Go ahead, pet him."
Brock Rumlow, Come on!
Brock Rumlow, This is for dropping a building on my face.
Brock Rumlow," I think I look pretty good, all things considered."
Steve Rogers, Who's your buyer?
Brock Rumlow," You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky."
Steve Rogers, What did you say?
Brock Rumlow," He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, ""Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go."" And you're coming with me."
Steve Rogers, Oh my . . . [Steve stares up.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.
Maria Stark," Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father."
Howard Stark, Who's the homeless person on the couch?
Young Tony, This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Maria Stark," Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad."
Howard Stark," Really, which broad? What's her name?"
Young Tony, Candice.
Howard Stark, Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Young Tony," Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?"
Maria Stark, Your father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
Howard Stark, We might have to make a quick stop.
Young Tony," At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary."
Howard Stark," You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags."
Maria Stark," He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it."
Young Tony," I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could."
Tony," That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh."
Tony," It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it."
 A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors, Tony.]
Tony," Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? ""To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke."
Tony," Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded."
Tony," No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now."
Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation, Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]
Tony, Go break some eggs.
MIT teacher," Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, ""Ooh, gross,"" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . ."
Tony," Restroom's this way, yeah?"
MIT teacher, Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
s Assistant," Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it."
Tony, It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT teacher, We'll catch up later.
 Spencer," That was nice, what you did for those young people."
Tony," Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience."
 Spencer, They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
Tony, Are you going up?
 Spencer, I'm right where I want to be.
Tony," Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard."
 Spencer, I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
Mrs Spencer, His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
Mrs Spencer," Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you."
Chaka," Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."
Wanda Maximoff, It's my fault.
Steve Rogers, That's not true.
Wanda Maximoff, Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
Steve Rogers, I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
Steve Rogers," Rumlow said ""Bucky"" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]"
Steve Rogers, And people died. It's on me.
Wanda Maximoff, It's on both of us.
Steve Rogers," This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved."
Wanda Maximoff, Vis! We talked about this.
Vision," Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . ."
Vision, Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
Steve Rogers, Thank you. We'll be right down.
Vision," I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest."
Steve Rogers, We know who it is?
Vision, The Secretary of State.
Secretary Ross," Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word ""vigilantes""."
Natasha Romanoff," And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?"
Secretary Ross," How about ""dangerous""? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?"
Secretary Ross, New York.
Secretary Ross, Washington DC.
Secretary Ross, Sokovia.
Secretary Ross, Lagos.
Steve Rogers, Okay. That's enough.
Secretary Ross," For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]"
Secretary Ross," The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary."
Steve Rogers, The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
Secretary Ross," Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?"
Secretary Ross," If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground."
James Rhodes," So, there are contingencies."
Secretary Ross," Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords."
Secretary Ross, Talk it over.
Natasha Romanoff, And if we come to a decision you don't like?
Secretary Ross, Then you retire.
Helmut Zemo, Hello? Is this your car out front?
Helmut Zemo, I jumped the curb.
Helmut Zemo," Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess."
Vasily Karpov, No. No cops.
Helmut Zemo, Thank you.
Helmut Zemo," You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations."
Helmut Zemo," ""Mission report: December 16, 1991."""
Vasily Karpov, Who are you?
Helmut Zemo," My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Vasily Karpov, How did you find me?
Helmut Zemo," When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those."
Vasily Karpov, What do you want?
Helmut Zemo, Mission report. December 16. 1991.
Vasily Karpov, Go . . . to . . . hell.
Helmut Zemo, HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
Vasily Karpov, Hail HYDRA.
James Rhodes," Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have."
Sam Wilson, So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
James Rhodes," A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, ""No, that's cool. We got it. """
Sam Wilson, How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision, I have an equation.
Sam Wilson," Oh, this will clear it up."
Vision," In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate."
Steve Rogers, Are you saying it's our fault?
Vision, I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
James Rhodes, Boom.
Natasha Romanoff, Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
Steve Rogers, It's because he's already made up his mind.
Tony," Boy, you know me so well."
Tony," Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache."
Tony," That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?"
Tony," Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia."
Tony," He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]"
Tony," There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys."
Steve Rogers," Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up."
Tony, Who said we're giving up?
Steve Rogers, We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
James Rhodes," I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA."
Steve Rogers," No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change."
Tony," That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing."
Steve Rogers," Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own."
Tony," If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty."
Wanda Maximoff, You're saying they'll come for me.
Vision, We would protect you.
Natasha Romanoff, Maybe Tony's right.
Natasha Romanoff," If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -"
Sam Wilson, Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
Natasha Romanoff, I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
Tony," Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?"
Natasha Romanoff," Oh, I want to take it back now."
Tony," No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win."
 A text message reads, 'She's gone. In her sleep.']
Steve Rogers, I have to go.
Priest," And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words."
Sharon Carter, Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
Sharon Carter," She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related."
Sharon Carter," I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say "" No, you move."""
Steve Rogers," When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her."
Natasha Romanoff," She had you back, too."
Steve Rogers, Who else signed?
Natasha Romanoff, Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
Steve Rogers, Clint?
Natasha Romanoff, Says he's retired.
Steve Rogers, Wanda?
Natasha Romanoff, TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff, Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
Steve Rogers, What are we giving up to do it?
Steve Rogers," I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it."
Natasha Romanoff, I know.
Steve Rogers, Then what are you doing here?
Natasha Romanoff, I didn't want you to be alone.
Natasha Romanoff, Come here.
UN staffer," Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?"
Natasha Romanoff, Yes?
UN staffer, These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.
Natasha Romanoff, Thanks.
Challa, I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
Natasha Romanoff," Oh, well, it's not always so flattering."
Challa, You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
Natasha Romanoff," Well, I'm not."
Challa," That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff."
Natasha Romanoff, Why? You don't approve of all this?
Challa," The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred."
Chaka, Unless you need to move a piano.
Challa, Father.
Chaka, Son. Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff," King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria."
Chaka, Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
Natasha Romanoff," Yes, so am I."
Man on speakers, If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
Challa, That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
Natasha Romanoff, Thank you. [Natasha goes.]
Chaka," For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it."
Challa," I'm happy, Father."
Chaka, Thank you.
Challa, Thank you.
Chaka," When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace."
Challa, EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
Sharon Carter," My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster."
Steve Rogers, Very practical.
Sharon Carter, And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]
Steve Rogers, CIA has you stationed over here now?
Sharon Carter," In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force."
Steve Rogers, Right. Right. Sounds fun.
Sharon Carter," I know, right?"
Steve Rogers, [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
Sharon Carter, You mean when I was doing my job.
Steve Rogers, Did Peggy know?
Sharon Carter, She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.
Steve Rogers, Sure. [Sam comes over.]
Sam Wilson, Steve. There's something you gotta see.
Sharon Carter, Who's coordinating?
Sharon Carter, Good. They're solid. Forensics?
Sharon Carter, I have to go to work.
Sharon Carter," Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]"
Natasha Romanoff, I'm very sorry.
Challa," [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever."
Natasha Romanoff, That sounds very peaceful.
Challa, My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.
Natasha Romanoff, T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
Challa," [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]"
Natasha Romanoff, Yeah?
Steve Rogers, You alright?
Natasha Romanoff," Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please."
Steve Rogers, Are you saying you'll arrest me?
Natasha Romanoff, No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
Steve Rogers," If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in."
Natasha Romanoff, Why?
Steve Rogers, Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]
Natasha Romanoff, Shit.
Sam Wilson, She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.
Steve Rogers, He'd do it for me.
Sam Wilson," 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]"
Sharon Carter," Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get."
Steve Rogers, Thank you.
Sharon Carter, And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
Helmut Zemo, Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]
German Innkeeper," Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ([subtitled] Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]"
Helmut Zemo, Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
German Innkeeper," Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)"
Helmut Zemo," Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)"
German Innkeeper, Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)
Helmut Zemo," Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]"
Bucky Barnes," [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])"
photos of a man and the head line, 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]
Sam Wilson," [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south."
Steve Rogers, Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?
Bucky Barnes, [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
Sam Wilson, They've set the perimeter.
Steve Rogers, I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
Bucky Barnes, I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
Sam Wilson, They're entering the building.
Steve Rogers," Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive."
Bucky Barnes, That's smart. Good strategy.
Sam Wilson, They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
Steve Rogers," This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck."
Bucky Barnes, It always ends in a fight.
Sam Wilson, 5 seconds.
Steve Rogers, You pulled me from the river. Why?
Bucky Barnes, I don't know.
Sam Wilson, 3 seconds!
Steve Rogers," Yes, you do."
Sam Wilson," Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]"
 Soldier," Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]"
Steve Rogers," Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone."
Bucky Barnes, [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.
 Soldier, Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
Steve Rogers," Come on, man."
Steve Rogers," Sam, southwest rooftop."
Sam Wilson, Who the hell's the other guy?
Steve Rogers, About to find out.
Steve Rogers, Sam.
Sam Wilson, Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]
 Driver," Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]"
Steve Rogers," Sam, I can't shake this guy."
Sam Wilson, Right behind you.
James Rhodes," Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]"
 Soldier, Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
James Rhodes, Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]
Vision, 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]
Wanda Maximoff, Is that paprikash?
Vision, I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
Wanda Maximoff," [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted."
Vision," In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . ."
Wanda Maximoff, May I?
Vision, Please. Wanda?
Wanda Maximoff, Hmm.
Vision," No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]"
Wanda Maximoff, Thanks.
Vision," Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you."
Wanda Maximoff, Are you?
Vision," My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]"
Wanda Maximoff," I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees."
Vision," [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me."
Wanda Maximoff, Are you afraid of it?
Vision," I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it."
Wanda Maximoff, [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Vision," Alternatively, we could order a pizza?"
Wanda Maximoff," Vision, are you not letting me leave?"
Vision, [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.
Wanda Maximoff, I can protect myself.
Vision, [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
Wanda Maximoff, And what do you want?
Vision, For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]
Sam Wilson," So, you like cats?"
Steve Rogers, Sam.
Sam Wilson, What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
Steve Rogers, Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
Challa," [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]"
Steve Rogers, What's gonna happen to him?
Everett Ross, Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon Carter," This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander."
Steve Rogers, What about our lawyer?
Everett Ross," Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt."
Sam Wilson, I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]
Everett Ross," You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?"
Challa, I don't intend on going anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff," For the record, this is what making things worse looks like."
Steve Rogers, He's alive.
Tony," [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup."
Natasha Romanoff, Try not to break anything while we fix this.
Tony," [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir."
Steve Rogers, 'Consequences'?
Tony, Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Steve Rogers," I'm not getting that shield back, am I?"
Natasha Romanoff," Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too."
Sam Wilson, That's cold.
Tony, Warmer than jail.
Delivery Truck Driver, Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
Tony," Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most."
Steve Rogers, Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
Tony," See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?"
Steve Rogers, Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
Tony," We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . ."
Steve Rogers, Pregnant?
Tony, No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
Steve Rogers," I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know."
Tony," A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work."
Steve Rogers," You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single."
Tony," Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you."
Steve Rogers, I don't mean to make things difficult.
Tony," I know, because you're a very polite person."
Steve Rogers, If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
Tony," No, you don't."
Steve Rogers," [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . ."
Tony," Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison."
Steve Rogers," [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards."
Tony," Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . ."
Steve Rogers, Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony," She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company."
Steve Rogers," Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . ."
Tony, What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
Steve Rogers," Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony."
Tony, She's not a US citizen.
Steve Rogers," Oh, come on, Tony."
Tony, And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
Steve Rogers, She's a kid!
Tony, GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
Steve Rogers, [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]
Helmut Zemo," [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?"
Sharon Carter, [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.
Sam Wilson, 'Bird costume'? Come on.
Sharon Carter, I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]
Helmut Zemo," I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James."
Bucky Barnes, My name is Bucky.
Delivery Truck Driver," Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)"
Custodian, Hier? (Here?)
Delivery Truck Driver, Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]
Steve Rogers, Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon Carter," Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?"
Steve Rogers," Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier."
Sharon Carter, You're saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam Wilson," Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing."
Steve Rogers, We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon Carter," Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]"
Steve Rogers, [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.
Helmut Zemo," [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?"
Bucky Barnes, I don't want to talk about it.
Helmut Zemo," You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one."
Custodian," Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)"
Delivery Truck Driver, Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
Everett Ross," Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go."
Tony," FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage."
Sharon Carter," [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]"
Bucky Barnes, What the hell is this?
Helmut Zemo," Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] Желание. ([subtitled] Longing.)"
Bucky Barnes, [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]
Helmut Zemo, Ржавый. ([subtitled] Rusted.)
Bucky Barnes, Stop.
Helmut Zemo, Семнадцать. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)
Bucky Barnes, [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]
Helmut Zemo, Рассвет. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)
Helmut Zemo, Печь. ([subtitled] Furnace.) Девять. ([subtitled] Nine.)
Helmut Zemo, Добросердечный. ([subtitled] Benign.)
Helmut Zemo, Возвращение на Родину. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) Один. ([subtitled:] One.) Грузовой вагон. ([subtitled] Freight car.)
Helmut Zemo, Солдат? ([subtitled] Soldier?)
Bucky Barnes, Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
Helmut Zemo," Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Helmut Zemo, Help me. Help.
Steve Rogers, [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?
Helmut Zemo, To see an empire fall.
 Ich wiederhole, Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
Sam Wilson, Hey.
Everett Ross," Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air."
Natasha Romanoff, Please tell me you brought a suit.
Tony," Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant."
Sharon Carter, Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]
Natasha Romanoff, [on radio:] We're in position.
Natasha Romanoff, You could at least recognize me.
Sam Wilson, Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]
s Wife," He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you."
 A TV news report is playing nearby,]
subtitled,"] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)"
 The screen above the gate reads, 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']
Sam Wilson," Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]"
Bucky Barnes, Steve.
Steve Rogers, Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky Barnes, Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve Rogers, Can't read that in a museum.
Sam Wilson," Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?"
Bucky Barnes, What did I do?
Steve Rogers, Enough.
Bucky Barnes," Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words."
Steve Rogers, Who was he?
Bucky Barnes, I don't know.
Steve Rogers," People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than ""I don't know."""
Bucky Barnes, He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve Rogers, Why would he need to know that?
Bucky Barnes, Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
Vasily Karpov," Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ([subtitled] Good work.)"
Vasily Karpov," Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)"
Steve Rogers, Who were they?
Bucky Barnes, Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
Sam Wilson, They all turn out like you?
Bucky Barnes, Worse.
Steve Rogers," The doctor, could he control them?"
Bucky Barnes, Enough.
Steve Rogers, Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky Barnes," With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming."
Sam Wilson, [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers, If we call Tony . . .
Sam Wilson," No, he won't believe us."
Steve Rogers, Even if he did . . .
Sam Wilson, Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
Steve Rogers, We're on our own.
Sam Wilson, Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross, I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
Tony, We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
Secretary Ross," You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this."
Natasha Romanoff," What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?"
Secretary Ross, If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony," All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in."
Secretary Ross, How would that end any differently from the last time?
Tony," Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed."
Secretary Ross, 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony," Thank you, sir. [Tony slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?"
Natasha Romanoff, [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?
Tony," Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez."
Natasha Romanoff, We're seriously understaffed.
Tony," Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?"
Natasha Romanoff, No. You really think he'd be on our side?
Tony, No.
Natasha Romanoff, I have an idea.
Tony, Me too. Where's yours?
Natasha Romanoff, Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]
Peter Parker," Hey, May."
May Parker, Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
Peter Parker, Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]
Tony," Oh, Mr. Parker."
Peter Parker," Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter."
Tony, Tony.
Peter Parker, What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
Tony," It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?"
Peter Parker, Yeah. Yeah.
Tony, Right?
Peter Parker, Regarding the . . .
May Parker, You didn't tell me about the grant.
Peter Parker, About the grant.
Tony, The September Foundation.
Peter Parker, Right.
Tony, Yeah. Remember when you applied?
Peter Parker, Yeah.
Tony," I approved, so now we're in business."
May Parker, You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
Peter Parker," Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?"
Tony, That's what I'm here to hash out.
Peter Parker," Okay. Hash, hash out, okay."
Tony, It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
May Parker," Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?"
Tony, This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Peter Parker, Let me just stop you there.
Tony, Yeah?
Peter Parker," Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?"
Tony, Yeah.
Peter Parker, Yeah?
Tony, It's pretty well funded.
Peter Parker, Wow.
Tony, Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
May Parker, Sure.
Tony," [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?"
Peter Parker," Uh, the garbage, actually."
Tony, You're a dumpster diver.
Peter Parker," Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant."
Tony, Ah-ah! Me first.
Peter Parker, Okay.
Tony," Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?"
Peter Parker," Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?"
Tony," Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills."
Peter Parker," That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer."
Tony, Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker, It's like that video. What is it?
Tony," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?"
Peter Parker, Exactly.
Tony," Oh, what have we here?"
Peter Parker, [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .
Tony, So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Peter Parker, [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.
Tony," Not in that onesie, you're not."
Peter Parker," It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!"
Tony, Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter Parker, Nobody.
Tony, Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
Peter Parker," No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out."
Tony, You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Peter Parker, I did.
Tony," Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?"
Peter Parker, It's a long story. I was uh . . .
Tony, Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter Parker," Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus."
Tony," You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?"
Peter Parker," Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months."
Tony, Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker," I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now."
Tony," Sure, because you're different."
Peter Parker," Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you."
Tony," [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?"
Peter Parker, Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
Tony," [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?"
Peter Parker," Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license."
Tony, You ever been to Germany?
Peter Parker, No.
Tony," Oh, you'll love it."
Peter Parker, I can't go to Germany!
Tony, Why?
Peter Parker, I got . . . homework.
Tony, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Peter Parker, I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
Tony, Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Peter Parker, [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.
Tony," Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this."
Peter Parker," Sorry, I'll get the . . ."
Wanda Maximoff, What is it?
Vision," Stay here, please."
Clint Barton, Guess I shoulda knocked.
Wanda Maximoff, Oh my god! What are you doing here?
Clint Barton, Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
Vision, Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.
Clint Barton," [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit."
Vision, Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint Barton," Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way."
Wanda Maximoff, I've caused enough problems.
Clint Barton," [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]"
Vision," Clint, you can't overpower me."
Clint Barton, I know I can't. But she can.
Wanda Maximoff," Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving."
Vision, I can't let you.
Wanda Maximoff," [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry."
Vision, [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff," I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]"
Clint Barton, Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre,]
Attache," It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans."
Security Chief," [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved."
Challa, As entertaining as that would be . . .
Natasha Romanoff, You really think you can find him?
Challa, My resources are considerable.
Natasha Romanoff," Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time."
Challa, You know where they are.
Natasha Romanoff, I know someone who does.
Under an overpass,]
Sharon Carter, Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve Rogers, It's low profile.
Sharon Carter," Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]"
Bucky Barnes, [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?
Sam Wilson, No.
Steve Rogers, I owe you again.
Sharon Carter," Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me."
Steve Rogers," Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you."
Sharon Carter, I know.
Steve Rogers," Thank you, Sharon."
Sharon Carter, That was . . .
Steve Rogers, Late.
Sharon Carter, Damn right. I should go.
Steve Rogers, Okay.
Clint Barton, Cap.
Steve Rogers, You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
Clint Barton," Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt."
Steve Rogers, Thanks for having my back.
Wanda Maximoff, It was time to get off my ass.
Steve Rogers, How about our other recruit?
Clint Barton," He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good."
Scott Lang, What timezone is this?
Clint Barton, Come on. Come on.
Scott Lang, [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.
Steve Rogers, Mr. Lang.
Scott Lang," It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!"
Sam Wilson," What's up, Tic Tac?"
Scott Lang," Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . ."
Sam Wilson," It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again."
Steve Rogers, They tell you what we're up against?
Scott Lang, Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
Steve Rogers," We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man."
Scott Lang," Yeah, well, what else is new?"
Bucky Barnes, We should get moving.
Clint Barton, We got a chopper lined up.
Bucky Barnes, They're evacuating the airport.
Sam Wilson, Stark.
Scott Lang, Stark?
Steve Rogers, Suit up.
Tony," Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?"
James Rhodes, Definitely weird.
Steve Rogers," Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this."
Challa, [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.
Steve Rogers, Your highness.
Tony," Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?"
Steve Rogers, You're after the wrong guy.
Tony, Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve Rogers," And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't."
Natasha Romanoff, Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
Tony," All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid."
Peter Parker," Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you."
Tony," Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation."
Peter Parker," Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man."
Tony," Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . ."
Peter Parker," Hey, everyone."
Tony, . . . Good job.
Steve Rogers, You've been busy.
Tony," And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart."
Steve Rogers, You did that when you signed.
Tony," Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on."
Sam Wilson," [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway."
Steve Rogers," [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang."
Peter Parker," Hey, guys, something . . ."
James Rhodes, Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
Scott Lang," [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America."
Tony," Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?"
James Rhodes," Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes."
Challa, Barnes is mine!
Peter Parker," Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?"
Tony, What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Peter Parker," Okay, copy that!"
Challa," Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time."
Scott Lang," [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you."
Natasha Romanoff," I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]"
Bucky Barnes, [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?
Sam Wilson, Everyone's got a gimmick now.
Peter Parker," [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]"
James Rhodes," Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]"
Tony," [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings."
Wanda Maximoff, You locked me in my room.
Tony," Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint."
Clint Barton," Hey, man."
Tony," Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?"
Clint Barton," Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]"
Tony, First time for everything.
Clint Barton, Made you look.
FRIDAY, Multiple contusions detected.
Tony," Yeah, I detected that too."
Peter Parker," Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?"
Sam Wilson, Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter Parker," That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man."
Sam Wilson, I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
Peter Parker," Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!"
Bucky Barnes, You couldn't have done that earlier?
Sam Wilson, I hate you.
James Rhodes, Great.
Scott Lang," Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]"
James Rhodes," Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]"
Scott Lang," Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]"
James Rhodes," Alright. Now, I'm pissed."
Natasha Romanoff," [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?"
Tony," Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?"
Clint Barton, [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.
Steve Rogers, Come on!
Vision, Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]
Sam Wilson," What do we do, Cap?"
Steve Rogers, We fight.
Natasha Romanoff, This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]
Peter Parker, They're not stopping.
Tony, Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]
Natasha Romanoff," We're still friends, right?"
Clint Barton," Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]"
Wanda Maximoff, You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]
Bucky Barnes, [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.
Challa," Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]"
Peter Parker, That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve Rogers, Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
Peter Parker," Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]"
Sam Wilson," [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?"
Clint Barton, Buckled in?
Scott Lang," Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]"
Steve Rogers," [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?"
Peter Parker, That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]
Steve Rogers," Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?"
Peter Parker, Queens.
Steve Rogers, Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]
Tony, [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?
FRIDAY, We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony, They what?
Scott Lang," Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop."
Tony, Who's speaking?
Scott Lang, It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Tony, Friday?
FRIDAY, Deploying fire suppression system.
Scott Lang," Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]"
Bucky Barnes, [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
Steve Rogers, We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam Wilson," No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here."
Clint Barton," As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it."
Sam Wilson," This isn't the real fight, Steve."
Steve Rogers," Alright, Sam, what's the play?"
Sam Wilson," We need a diversion, something big."
Scott Lang," I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me."
Bucky Barnes, He's gonna tear himself in half?
Steve Rogers," You're sure about this, Scott?"
Scott Lang," I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]"
Peter Parker, Holy shit!
James Rhodes," Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now."
Steve Rogers, I guess that's the signal.
Sam Wilson," Way to go, Tic Tac!"
Tony, Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]
Peter Parker, I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]
Tony," Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion."
Scott Lang," You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]"
Clint Barton, We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.
Challa, I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]
James Rhodes, Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]
Scott Lang," Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]"
Natasha Romanoff, You're not gonna stop.
Steve Rogers, You know I can't.
Natasha Romanoff, I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]
Peter Parker," [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?"
James Rhodes," Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?"
Tony," I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side."
Peter Parker, [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]
Tony, Maybe the kid's on to something.
James Rhodes," High now, Tony. Go high."
Peter Parker," [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]"
Scott Lang, Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony," [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?"
Peter Parker, Hey! Get off me!
Tony, Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Peter Parker," Oh. Hey, man."
Tony, Yeah.
Peter Parker, That was scary.
Tony, Yeah. You're done. Alright?
Peter Parker, What?
Tony, You did a good job. Stay down.
Peter Parker," No, I'm good. I'm fine."
Tony, Stay down.
Peter Parker," No, it's good I gotta get him back!"
Tony, You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Peter Parker," Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done."
Natasha Romanoff," [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference."
Vision, [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.
Wanda Maximoff," Me, too."
Vision, It's as I said. Catastrophe.
James Rhodes," Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider."
Tony, Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]
James Rhodes," Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]"
Tony," RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals."
FRIDAY, Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam Wilson, [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]
German Innkeeper," Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)"
Helmut Zemo," Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)"
German Innkeeper," Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)"
Helmut Zemo, Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)
German Innkeeper, Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]
Bucky Barnes, What's gonna happen to your friends?
Steve Rogers," [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is… I'll deal with it."
Bucky Barnes," [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve."
Steve Rogers, [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
Bucky Barnes, I know. But I did it.
Tony, How did this happen?
Vision, I became distracted.
Tony, I didn't think that was possible.
Vision, Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]
Tony, The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha Romanoff," Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario."
Tony," You let them go, Nat."
Natasha Romanoff, We played this wrong.
Tony," 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA."
Natasha Romanoff, Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
Tony," T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you."
Natasha Romanoff, I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]
Tony," [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?"
FRIDAY, Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony, Fire up the chopper.
FRIDAY, The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
Tony, Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY, What do I look like?
Tony," Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head."
FRIDAY, You must be thinking of someone else.
Tony, Must be.
FRIDAY," The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad."
Tony," So, what happened to the real Broussard?"
FRIDAY, He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony, Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY," Yes, Boss."
 he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled, 'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
Guard," [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark."
Tony," So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy."
Secretary Ross," You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]"
Clint Barton," [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not."
Tony," Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on."
Clint Barton," [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony."
Tony," Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . ."
Clint Barton," Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are."
Tony, Because you broke the law.
Clint Barton, Yeah.
Tony, I didn't make you.
Clint Barton," La, la, la, la, la . . ."
Tony," You read it, you broke it."
Clint Barton," La, la, la, la la…"
Tony," Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]"
Clint Barton, You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Scott Lang," Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark."
Tony, Who are you?
Scott Lang," Come on, man."
Sam Wilson, How's Rhodes?
Tony, They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam Wilson, [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?
Tony, I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam Wilson," Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me."
Tony," Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment."
Secretary Ross, [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony," [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong."
Sam Wilson, That's a first.
Tony, Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Sam Wilson," Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend."
Tony, Easy.
Secretary Ross, Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Tony," Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]"
Steve Rogers, You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky Barnes, Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve Rogers, You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
Bucky Barnes, What was her name again?
Steve Rogers, Dolores. You called her Doll.
Bucky Barnes, She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
Steve Rogers," So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]"
Steve Rogers, He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Bucky Barnes, Long enough to wake them up.
Steve Rogers, You ready?
Bucky Barnes, Yeah.
Tony, You seem a little defensive.
Steve Rogers, It's been a long day.
Tony," At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you."
Steve Rogers, Then why are you here?
Tony," Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself."
Steve Rogers," Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony."
Tony," You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]"
Tony, I got heat signatures.
Steve Rogers, How many?
Tony," Uh, one."
Helmut Zemo," [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?"
Bucky Barnes, What the hell?
Helmut Zemo," I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets."
Tony, I'm betting I could beat that.
Helmut Zemo," Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came."
Steve Rogers, You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]
Helmut Zemo," I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw."
Steve Rogers, You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Helmut Zemo, Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
Steve Rogers, [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?
Helmut Zemo," [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever."
Tony," [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?"
Howard Stark, Help my wife. Please. Help.
Howard Stark, Sergeant Barnes?
Maria Stark, Howard!
Maria Stark, Howard!
Steve Rogers, Tony. Tony.
Tony, [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?
Steve Rogers, I didn't know it was him.
Tony," Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?"
Steve Rogers, Yes.
Steve Rogers, [to Bucky] Get out of here!
Steve Rogers," It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!"
Tony, Move!
Steve Rogers, It wasn't him!
FRIDAY, Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony, Ah crap.
Steve Rogers, He's not going to stop. Go.
Tony," Come on, come on."
FRIDAY," Targeting system's knackered, boss."
Tony," I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?"
Bucky Barnes, I remember all of them.
Steve Rogers, This isn't gonna change what happened.
Tony, I don't care. He killed my mom.
s Wife," You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you."
Challa, [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.
Helmut Zemo, Hardly an innocent one.
Challa, This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
Helmut Zemo," [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, ""Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm."" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son."
Challa, Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
Helmut Zemo, [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]
Challa, The living are not done with you yet.
FRIDAY, You can't beat him hand to hand.
Tony, Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY, Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.
Tony," [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]"
Steve Rogers, He's my friend.
Tony, So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.
Steve Rogers," [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day."
Tony," That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]"
Everett Ross," Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?"
Helmut Zemo, [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?
Tony, It's just the first pass.
James Rhodes, Yeah.
Tony, Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
James Rhodes, You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]
Tony, Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
James Rhodes," No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]"
Tony, You okay?
James Rhodes, Oh yeah.
FedEx Driver Stan Lee," [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony ""Stank""?"
James Rhodes," Yes, this is--this is Tony ""Stank"". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. ""Stank"". Please, by the bathroom."
Steve Rogers," [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]"
FRIDAY, Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Tony," Yeah, put him through."
Secretary Ross," Tony, we have a problem."
Tony," Ah, please hold."
Secretary Ross, No. Don't . . .
Steve Rogers," [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there."
Steve Rogers, You sure about this?
Bucky Barnes," I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]"
Steve Rogers, Thank you for this.
Challa," Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…"
Steve Rogers," You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him."
Challa, Let them try.
May Parker, So. Who was it? Who hit you?
Peter Parker," Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]"
May Parker," What's ""some guy's"" name?"
Peter Parker," Uh, Steve."
May Parker, Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
Peter Parker," No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch."
May Parker, Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
Peter Parker," Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you."
May Parker," Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]"
Peter Parker," Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]"
Toomes," Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians."
Mason," Actually, it's Native American, but whatever."
Toomes," Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain't bad, is it?"
Mason, No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.
Toomes," Yeah, well... We'll see, I guess."
Toomes," No, hey! Uh-uh! You can't saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use."
Toomes, See?
Schultz, All right.
Toomes," All right. (to Brice) Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon."
Brice, Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
Toomes," Yeah, yeah, yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us."
Anne Marie Hoag," Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here."
Toomes, Who the hell are you?
DODC Agent, Qualified personnel.
Toomes," Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-"
Anne Marie Hoag," I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected, or you will be prosecuted."
Toomes," Ma'am, what am I- Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I'm all in on this. I could lose my house."
Anne Marie Hoag," I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do."
DODC Agent," Maybe next time, don't over extend yourself."
Toomes, What'd you say?
Toomes," Yeah, he's right. I overextended myself."
Worker, Don't do it.
Anne Marie Hoag, Put them down.
Anne Marie Hoag," If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors."
Toomes, Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
News Anchor," A joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government, the Department of Damage Control will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials."
Schultz, So now the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up.
Mason," Yeah, it’s all rigged."
News Anchor, Experts estimate there are over fifteen hundred tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Worker," Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We’re supposed to turn this in, right?"
Brice, I ain’t hauling it.
Mason, It’s too bad. We could have made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.
Toomes," I tell you what, let’s keep it. The world’s changing."
Toomes," It’s time we change, too."
Toomes," There you go, Mason."
Toomes, Business is good.
Peter," (in a gravelly voice) New York. Queens. It’s a rough borough, but hey, it’s home."
Happy, Who are you talking to?
Peter, (in a normal voice) No one. Just making a little video of the trip.
Happy, You know you can’t show it to anyone.
Peter," Yeah, I know."
Happy, Then why are you narrating in that voice?
Peter, Uh... Because it’s fun.
Happy, Fun.
Peter," So, uh, why do they call you Happy?"
Happy, Come on. I’m not carrying your bags. Let’s go.
Peter," Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?"
Happy, There’s a bathroom on it.
Peter, Whoa. No pilot? That’s awesome.
Happy, Is that where you’re gonna sit?
Peter, Yeah.
Happy, This is your first time on a private plane?
Peter, My first time on any plane.
Peter, Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?
Peter, Shh.
Peter, No one has actually told me why I’m in Berlin or what I’m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.
Happy, (pointing at a door) This is you.
Peter," Oh, we’re neighbors?"
Happy, We’re not roommates. Suit up.
Peter," Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this."
Happy, What the hell are you wearing?
Peter, It’s my suit.
Happy, Where’s the case?
Peter, What case? That’s not my...
Peter, What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?
Happy, Go. Please.
Peter, My room is way bigger than...
Happy, There.
Peter, I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.
Peter, “A minor upgrade”?
Peter, Whoa. Oh my God.
Happy, Put it on.
Peter, What the...? This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen-
Happy, Let’s go.
Peter," But, yeah. Well, I don’t understand. Is it for me?"
Peter," Happy, Happy, wait."
Peter, This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.
Happy, Let’s go.
Peter, Okay.
Happy, Come on.
Peter," (whispers) Okay, there’s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who’s that new guy?"
Tony, Underoos!
Peter," Oh, that’s me. I gotta go. I gotta go."
Peter," Hey, everyone."
Peter," Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him-"
Peter, What the hell? He’s big now. I gotta go. Hang on.
Peter, Whoa!
Peter," It was the most amazing thing that’s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, “Hey, Underoos!” and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap’s shield. I was like, “Hey, what’s up, everybody?” And then..."
Peter," Hey, just a second! Coming!"
Peter, Hey.
Happy, We have thin walls here.
Tony," What are you doing, a little video diary?"
Peter, (embarrassed) Yeah.
Tony, It’s all right. I’d probably do the same.
Happy, (from the driver’s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.
Tony, It’s okay.
Happy, I’m gonna wipe the chip.
Tony," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?"
Peter," Yeah, hold on."
Tony, We rolling?
Peter, An alibi? Sure.
Tony, Get in the frame.
Peter, Okay.
Tony," Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope."
Tony," Peter, that’s inappropriate. All right, let’s start over. You can edit it."
Peter, Mm-hmm.
Tony," Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed."
Happy, Come on! It’s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I’m sorry.
Tony," This is because you’re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver."
Happy, That was a private conversation. I don’t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.
Tony," No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?"
Happy, All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.
Tony," Happy, can you give us a moment?"
Happy, You want me to leave the car?
Tony, Why don’t you grab Peter’s case out of the trunk.
Peter, I can keep the suit?
Tony," Yes, we were just talking about it."
Tony," Do me a favor, though. Happy’s kind of your point guy on this. Don’t stress him out. Don’t do anything stupid. I’ve seen his cardiogram. All right?"
Peter, (enthusiastically) Yes.
Tony," Don’t do anything I would do, and definitely don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. There’s a... There’s a little grey area in there, and that’s where you operate."
Peter," Wait, does that mean that I’m an Avenger?"
Tony, No.
Happy, This it?
Tony, Seventh floor.
Peter, I can take that. You don’t have to take it.
Happy, You’re gonna take it?
Peter," Yeah, I can take that."
Happy, Thank you.
Peter," So when’s, when’s our next... When’s our next “retreat,” you know? Like..."
Tony," What, next mission?"
Peter," Yeah, the mission. The missions."
Tony, We’ll call you.
Peter, Do you have my numbers?
Tony," No, I mean, we’ll call you. Like, someone will call you."
Peter, Oh.
Tony, All right?
Peter, From your team.
Tony, Okay.
Tony, It’s not a hug. I’m just grabbing the door for you. We’re not there yet.
 Tony calls out,]
Tony, Bye.
Peter, They’re gonna call me.
Flash," What’s up, Penis Parker?"
Betty," Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology."
Jason," Students, don’t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming?"
Betty," Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date."
Jason, Okay.
Betty, Yeah.
Principal Morita, Good morning.
Principal Morita," Damn it. You, in my office right now."
Ned," (imitating Emperor Palpatine) Join me, and together... we’ll build my new Lego Death Star."
Peter, What?
Peter glances around and hears a cheerleader say,]
Cheerleader, So lame.
Peter, No way! That’s awesome. How many pieces?
Ned, Three thousand eight hundred and three.
Peter, That’s insane.
Ned, I know. You want to build it tonight?
Peter," No, I can’t tonight. I’ve got the Stark-"
Ned, Mm-hmm. Stark internship.
Peter," Yeah, exactly."
Ned, Always got that internship.
Peter," Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it’ll lead to a real job with them."
Ned, That would be so sweet.
Peter, Right?
Ned," He’d be all, “Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here’s a gold coin.”"
Ned, I don’t know how jobs work.
Peter, That’s exactly how they work.
Ned," Oh. (chuckles) I’ll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place. And, and then I’ll come by afterwards..."
Ned," ...because for the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops."
Peter, That’d be great.
Girl, I’m gonna be late!
 Warren," Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?"
 Warren, Flash.
Flash, It’s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass.
 Warren, Nope.
 Warren, Peter. You still with us?
Peter," Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah."
Peter," Uh... Mass cancels out, so it’s just gravity times sine."
 Warren," Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn’t always the best if you are wrong."
Flash, (whispers) You’re dead.
 Cobbwell," Today we’ll be talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr, but trust me, there is nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory."
Peter, Did Liz get a new top?
Ned," No. We’ve seen that before, but never with that skirt."
Girl," Liz, hey."
Liz, Hi!
Girl, That looks so good!
Peter," We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though."
Michelle, Too late.
Michelle, You guys are losers.
Ned, But then why do you sit with us?
Michelle, Because I don’t have any friends.
Liz, Let’s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?
Charles, Hydrogen’s the lightest. That’s not the question. Okay. Yeah.
Abe, Uranium.
Liz," That is correct. Thank you, Abraham."
Abe, (quietly pumping his fist in the air) Yes.
Liz, Please open your books to page ten.
 Harrington," Peter, it’s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off?"
Peter," I can’t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I’m here."
Flash, You’ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.
Cindy," Wait, what’s happening?"
Sally, Peter’s not going to Washington.
Cindy," No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No."
Abe, Why not?
Liz, Really? Right before nationals?
Michelle, He already quit marching band and robotics lab.
 Michelle quickly adds,]
Michelle, I’m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.
Liz," Flash, you’re in for Peter."
Flash," Ooh, I don’t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up."
Abe, That is false.
 Harrington, What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?
Peter turns to see the clock, it’s still 1:18 p.m.]
Peter," Hey, what’s up?"
Man," Hey, man."
Peter," What’s up, Mr. Delmar?"
 Delmar," Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right?"
Peter," Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks."
Deli Clerk," You got it, boss."
 Delmar, How’s your aunt?
Peter," Yeah, she’s alright."
 Delmar, La tía de é les una italiana muy bellissima. (His aunt is a very hot Italian woman.)
Deli Clerk," ¿Ah, sí? (Oh, yeah?)"
Peter," ¿Cómo está tu hija, eh? (How is your daughter, huh?)"
 Delmar, Ten dollars.
Peter, It’s five dollars.
 Delmar," For that comment, ten dollars."
Peter," Hey, come on, I’m joking. I’m joking."
Peter, Here’s five dollars.
Peter," What’s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?"
 Delmar," So, how’s school?"
Peter," Ah, you know, it’s boring. Got better things to do."
 Delmar," Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you’re gonna end up like me."
Peter, This is great.
 Delmar, Best sandwiches in Queens.
Peter," Ah, finally."
Peter," Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks."
Peter," Hey, is this anybody’s bike? No?"
Peter," Hey, buddy, is this your bike?"
Man, I have no change.
Peter, Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?
 Peter has left a note saying," “IS THIS YOUR BIKE? IF NOT, DON’T STEAL IT! SPIDER-MAN.”]"
Peter, Whoo! Everybody good?
 when a man calls out,]
Street Vendor," Hey! You’re that spider guy on YouTube, right?"
Peter, Call me Spider-Man!
Street Vendor," Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip."
Street Vendor, Yeah!
Man, Not bad.
Peter," Hey, buddy. Shouldn’t steal cars. It’s bad."
Car Jacker," It’s my car, dumbass!"
Marjorie, Hey! Shut that off!
Peter, I was just tryin’ to-
Car Jacker, Can you tell him it’s my car?
Day Sleeper," I work at nights! Come on, dude!"
Old Man, That’s not your car! That’s his car.
Peter, How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!
Gary," Don’t make me come down there, you punk!"
Marjorie," Hey, Gary. How you doing?"
Gary," Marjorie, how are you? How’s your mother?"
Peter," Ugh! I’m good, I’m good."
Voicemail, You have reached the voicemail box of...
Happy, Happy Hogan.
Peter," Hey, Happy! Um, here’s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn’t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It’s Peter. Parker."
Peter, Why would I tell him about the churro?
Peter," Finally, something good."
Peter," (clears his throat) What’s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number?"
Peter, Whoa! You’re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here?
Peter, Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you’d be more handsome in person.
Peter," Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You’re a billionaire."
 His voice is all distorted when he says,]
Peter," Hey! Oh, this feels so weird."
Peter," Whoa, what is that thing?"
Peter, I’m starting... to think... you’re not... the Avengers!
 Operator, 911. What’s your emergency?
 Delmar, Uh... Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street.
Peter," Alright guys, let’s wrap this up. It’s a school night."
Peter," So, how do jerks like you get tech like this?"
Peter," No. Wait, wait, wait!"
Peter, Mr. Delmar.
Peter," Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello?"
Peter," Oh, come on. You’ve got to be-"
Peter," Here, here."
 Delmar," Good, yeah."
Happy," (to Dum-E) Okay. Good. Yes. Yes- No. No, put that down. That’s worth more than you or me. (takes a call) Yeah?"
Peter," Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-"
Happy," Hey, take a breath, okay? I don’t have time for ATM robberies..."
Peter," Yeah, but-"
Happy, ...or the thoughtful notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything’s gotta be out of here by next week.
Peter, Wait. Wait! You’re moving? Who’s moving?
Happy," Yeah, don’t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We’re relocating to a new facility upstate where, hopefully, the cell service is much worse."
Peter, But what about me?
Happy, What about you?
Peter," Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don’t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?"
Happy," Look, just stay away from anything too dangerous. I’m responsible for making sure you’re responsible, okay?"
Peter," I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack’s gone."
Happy, That doesn’t sound responsible.
Peter, I’ll call you back.
Happy, Feel free not to.
May, What was that?
Peter," Uh, it’s nothing. It’s nothing!"
Ned, You’re the Spider-Man. From YouTube.
Peter, I’m not. I’m not.
Ned, You were on the ceiling.
Peter," No, I wasn’t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?"
Ned, May let me in. You said we were gonna finish the Death Star.
Peter, You can’t just bust into my room!
May," The turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let’s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?"
Ned, Yes.
Peter, No. He’s got a thing.
Ned, A thing to do after.
May, Okay.
May, Maybe put on some clothes.
Ned," Oh, she doesn’t know?"
Peter," Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that’s it."
Ned, (whispers) Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?
Peter," (hesitates) Yeah, basically."
Ned, Whoa...
Peter, You can’t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.
Ned, A secret? Why?
Peter," You know what she’s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she’s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please."
Ned," Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I’ll level with you. I don’t think I can keep this a secret. This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me, Peter!"
Peter," Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that’s happened with her, I... Please."
Ned, Okay.
Peter," Just swear it, okay?"
Ned, I swear.
Peter, Thank you.
Ned, Yeah.
Peter, I can’t believe this is happening right now.
Ned, Can I try the suit on?
Peter, No.
Ned, How does it work? Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
Peter," I’m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?"
Ned," Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship?"
Peter, This is the Stark internship.
Ned, Oh.
Peter, Just get out of here.
May, What’s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It’s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say “larb” before you talk to me? You know I larb you.
Peter," I’m just stressed. The internship, and I’m tired. A lot of work."
May," The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. Distracted all the time... he’s got you in your head."
News Anchor," The beloved Queens’ institution, Delmar’s Sandwiches, was destroyed..."
May, What does he have you doing?
News Anchor, ...in an explosion...
May, You need to use your instincts.
News Anchor," ...earlier tonight after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens’ own colorful local crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed."
May," If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way."
Peter," Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course."
May, Six blocks away from us.
Peter, I... uh... I need a new backpack.
May, What?
Peter, I need a new backpack.
May, That’s five.
Thai Waiter, Sticky rice pudding.
May," Oh, we didn’t order that."
Thai Waiter, It’s on the house.
May, Oh! Thanks. (to Peter) That’s nice of him.
Peter, I think he larbs you.
Ned," You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would’ve hurt, right? You know what? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I’d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?"
Peter," The spider’s dead, Ned."
Ned, Whoa.
Ned, You were here?
Peter, Yeah.
Ned, You could’ve died.
Ned, Do you lay eggs?
Peter, What? No.
Ned, (in a low voice) Can you spit venom?
Peter, No.
Ned, Can you summon an army of spiders?
Peter," No, Ned."
History Teacher, The Sokovia Accords were put into place...
Ned, How far can you shoot your webs?
Peter, It’s unknown. Shut up.
History Teacher, ...to begin regulating...
Ned," If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I could-"
Peter," Shut up, Ned."
Steve, Hi. I’m Captain America. Whether you’re in the classroom or on the battlefield...
Ned, Do you know him too?
Peter," Yeah, we met."
Steve, ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.
Peter, I stole his shield.
Ned, What?
Steve," Today, my good friend, your gym teacher..."
Steve, ...will be conducting the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Station I, Sit-ups’.]
Coach Wilson," Thank you, Captain. I’m pretty sure this guy’s a war criminal now, but whatever. I have to show these videos. It’s required by the state. Let’s do it."
Ned, Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
Peter, Shh!
Ned, What does Hulk smell like?
Peter, Shh!
Ned, I bet he smells nice.
Peter, You have to shut up.
Ned," Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?"
Peter," Ned, just, shh, okay?"
Ned," Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?"
Peter, What?
Ned, Yeah. You know how there’s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go?
Ned," Like, like if you’re stuck in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. Because there’d be screens around me, and I could, you know, swivel around, and... ‘Cause I could be your guy in the chair."
Peter," Ned, I don’t need a guy in the chair."
Coach Wilson," Looking good, Parker."
Betty," Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man, and kill Hulk."
Charles," Well, what about the Spider-Man?"
Betty, It’s just Spider-Man.
Liz, Did you guys see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Betty," Oh my God, she’s crushing on Spider-Man."
Charles, No way.
Liz, (shrugs) Kind of?
Betty," Ugh, gross."
Betty," He’s probably like, thirty."
Charles," You don’t even know what he looks like. Like, what if he’s, like, seriously burned?"
Liz, I wouldn’t care. I would still love him for the person he is on the inside.
Ned, (in a loud voice) Peter knows Spider-Man!
Peter," (stuttering) No, I don’t. No. I... I mean..."
Ned, They’re friends.
Flash," Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends."
Peter," (stuttering) I’ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it’s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm."
Peter," Yeah, well. I’m not really supposed to talk about it."
Flash," Well, that’s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz’s party. Right?"
Liz," Yeah, I’m having people over tonight. You’re more than welcome to come."
Peter, Having a party?
Flash," Yeah, it’s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man."
Peter, Um...
Liz," It’s okay. I know Peter’s way too busy for parties anyway, so..."
Flash," Come on. He’ll be there. Right, Parker?"
Peter, What are you doing?
Ned, (in a hushed voice) Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you.
Ned," Dude, you’re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it’s you."
May," House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous."
Ned, It’ll be a night to remember.
May," (laughs) Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat."
Ned," Yeah, it gives me confidence."
May, Hmm.
Peter," This is a mistake. (to May) Hey, let’s just go home."
May," Oh, Peter. I know. I know it’s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body’s going through. It’s flowering now."
Peter, Uh-huh.
May, (to Ned) He’s so stressed out lately.
Ned, What helps with stress is going to a party. We should go to the party.
Peter," Yeah, let’s do it. Yeah. I’m gonna go. I’m gonna go."
May, Peter.
May," Have fun, okay?"
Peter, (nods) I will.
May, (in a soft voice) Okay.
Ned," Bye, May!"
Ned," Dude, you have the suit, right?"
Peter, Yeah.
Ned, This is gonna change our lives.
Girl," Annie, over here!"
Annie, Hey.
Male Voice, DJ Flash!
Ned," Okay. We’re gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs."
Michelle, Can’t believe you guys are at this lame party.
Ned, But you’re here too.
Michelle, Am I?
Liz," Oh, my gosh."
Liz," Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned."
Ned," Hi, Liz."
Peter," Hi, Liz."
Liz, I’m so happy you guys came. There’s pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
Peter, What a great party.
Liz, Thanks.
Liz," (sheepish) Oh, I... My parents will kill me if anything’s broken. I gotta-"
Peter, Yeah.
Liz, Have fun.
Ned, Bye.
Liz, Bye.
Ned," Dude, what are you doing? She’s here. Spider it up."
Peter," No, no, no. I can’t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I’m just gonna... be myself."
Ned," (sighs) Peter, no one wants that."
Peter, Dude.
Flash," (into a microphone) Penis Parker, what’s up?"
Flash," So, where’s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess. In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?"
Flash, That’s not Spider-Man. That’s just Ned in a red shirt.
Peter," Hey, what’s up? I’m Spider-Man. Just thought I’d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what’s up, Ned? Hey, where’s Peter, anyways? He must be around..."
Peter," God, this is stupid. What am I doing?"
Peter, What the hell?
Peter, (gasping) This sucks!
Brice," Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try."
Aaron," Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?"
Brice," Okay, okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec."
Brice," Okay, I got, uh, black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns..."
Schultz," You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We’re the only ones selling these high tech weapons."
Peter," (whispers) Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff."
Aaron, I need something to stick up somebody. I’m not trying to shoot them back in time.
Brice, I got anti-grav climbers.
Aaron," Yo, climbers?"
Brice," Okay, what the hell was that?"
Schultz, Did you set us up?
Aaron," Hey, hey, man."
Peter," Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me."
Schultz, All right.
Peter, What was that?
Peter, What? Ah!
Schultz, We gotta call him.
Brice," No, no, no, no."
Schultz, Did you just do it again?
Brice, Shut up.
Schultz, I’m calling him.
Mason, Toomes’ phone.
Mason, Boss.
Peter," Oh, my butt! Unh!"
Peter, Great. Guess I’m gonna have to take a shortcut.
Peter," Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun."
Peter," Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch."
Peter," Whoo! Now, this is more like it."
Peter," Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Peter, Whoa.
Peter, Smells really good!
Peter, Great movie!
Peter," Ugh... Oh, hey, guys."
Tent Kids, Aahhh!
Peter, No! No!
Peter," (on recording) Hey, it’s Peter. Leave a message."
Ned," (whispers) Peter, where are you? The hat’s not working. This is not cool."
Peter, Almost got you.
Peter," (panting) Thought you got away from me, didn’t you? I got you right where I want you."
Peter, Surprise!
Peter, What the hell?
Peter, Aahhhh!
Peter," Huh? Oh, hey."
Peter," And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How’d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?"
Tony, I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.
Peter, Whoa!
Peter," Whew, that’s better. Thanks."
Tony, What were you thinking?
Peter, The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Tony," Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing."
Peter, The Avengers?
Tony," No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade."
Peter," Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn’t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine."
Tony," Oh, I’m not here."
Tony, Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you’re at it.
Tony, Cheers.
Tony," Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please."
Peter, Why?
Tony, Why? Because I said so!
Tony," Sorry, I’m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can’t you just be a friendly..."
Tony, ...neighborhood Spider-Man?
Peter, But I’m ready for more than that now.
Tony," No, you are not."
Peter, That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.
Tony," Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would’ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy."
Peter, Are you driving?
Tony," You know, it’s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call."
Peter," No, I don’t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-"
Friday, Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
Peter, That’s awesome.
Peter, (mutters) Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?
Peter, Whoa.
Peter," Hey, man, what’s up? I’m on my way back."
Ned," Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn’t come. Listen to this."
Flash," When I say “penis,” you say “Parker.” Penis!"
Crowd, Parker!
Flash, Penis!
Crowd, Parker!
Ned," Sorry, Peter. I guess we’re still losers. I’ll see you tomorrow."
Peter, I’ll see you tomorrow in school.
Mason," Whoa, whoa."
Toomes, Idiots. Idiots.
Toomes, Idiots!
Mason, Boss. Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light?
Toomes, What’d I tell you about looking at my phone?
Mason," Oh, sorry. You left it out. You know I’m a curious person by nature."
Mason, I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.
Toomes, Huh?
Mason," In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?"
Toomes," You’re still on that? I told you, no. The answer’s no. Forget it."
Brice, Whoo!
Brice," I mean, that was badass."
Toomes, How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?
Brice," You said, move the merchandise."
Toomes," Under the radar. Under the radar! That’s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we’re through. You’re out there wearing that goofy thing, lightning up cars, calling yourself the Shocker. “I’m the Shocker. I shock people.” What is this, pro wrestling?"
Brice," Ah, whatever, old man. Come on."
Toomes," Look, look. I know you don’t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after."
Brice," (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Toomes, You know what? I can’t afford your bullshit. Get out of here.
Brice, What?
Toomes, You’re done. You’re off the crew.
Brice," Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know."
Toomes, Excuse me?
Brice," Um, I’m just saying..."
Brice, ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.
Toomes, You know what?
Brice, What?
Toomes," You’re right. (to Mason, in a low voice) That work?"
Mason, I don’t know.
Toomes, I can’t afford that.
Schultz, Damn.
Toomes, I thought this was the antigravity gun.
Mason," What? No, that’s that one."
Toomes, Here. Now you’re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.
Schultz, All right.
Peter, Oh.
Ned," Hey, thanks for bailing on me."
Peter," Yeah, well, something came up."
Ned," Oh, what is that?"
Peter, I don’t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
Ned, Seriously?
Peter, Yeah.
Ned, Awesome.
Ned," I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary."
Peter," Well, look, I think it’s a power source."
Ned," Yeah, but it’s connected to all these microprocessors. That’s an inductive charging plate. That’s what I use to charge my toothbrush."
Peter, Whoever’s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.
Ned, That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing-
 Hapgood, Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
Peter, I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.
Ned, We’ll go to the lab after class and run some tests.
Peter, Let’s do it.
Ned," First, I say we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer."
Peter," First, we gotta come up with a better name than “glowy thingy.”"
Ned, You’re right.
Peter, Crap.
Peter," (whispers) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
Schultz, High schools creep me out.
Schultz," They got this funny smell, you know?"
Peter," Hey, that’s one of the guys that tried to kill me."
Ned, What?
Peter, Yeah.
Ned, We gotta get out of here.
Peter," No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake."
Ned, Someone dropped you in a lake?
Peter," Yeah, it was not good."
Ned, (whispers) Peter-
Peter," (whispers) No. Stay there, Ned."
Ned, (whispers) Peter.
Tiny, What are you doing?
Ned, (in a normal voice) Nothing.
Tiny, Oh.
Ned, Yeah. You good?
Tiny, Chess.
Randy, Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?
Schultz, It’s saying there was an energy pulse right here.
Randy," There’s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it’s gone."
Schultz, So are we.
Ned, This is so awesome.
Peter," I know, right?"
Peter, They’re in Brooklyn.
Ned, Staten Island.
Ned, Leaving Jersey.
Ned, They stopped.
Peter, Maryland?
Ned, What’s there?
Peter, I don’t know. Evil lair?
Ned, They have a lair?
Peter," Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair."
Ned," (nods) Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it’s, like, 300 miles away?"
Peter, It’s not too far from D.C.
Abe," Hey, it’s Peter."
Peter, Guys.
Liz, Peter?
Friend," Hey, buddy."
Peter," Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team."
Flash," No, no way. You can’t just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone."
 Harrington," Hey, welcome back, Peter. Flash, you’re back to first alternate."
Flash, What?
Abe, He’s taking your place.
Michelle," Excuse me, can we go already? ‘Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner, so."
 Harrington, Protesting is patriotic. Let’s get on the bus.
Liz," Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn."
Cindy, The second law of thermodynamics.
Charles, Frank Sinatra.
Flash, Fort Sumter.
Abe, Flash is wrong.
Liz," Okay, guys, let’s focus. Next one."
 Harrington," Liz, don’t overwork them."
Peter," Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium."
Liz," Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back."
Peter, Glad to be back.
Liz, What is the current standard unit of radioactive-
Peter, Can I take this real quick? I’ll only be a sec.
Liz," Yeah, fine."
Peter, Hello?
Happy, Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?
Liz," Okay, focus up, everyone."
Peter, Tracker.
Peter," (in a normal voice) Uh, yeah. No, it’s just a school trip. It’s, uh, it’s nothing."
Peter," Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy."
Peter, (whispers) That’s different.
Happy, What’s different?
Peter," Nothing. Look, it’s just the Academic Decathlon. It’s no big deal."
Happy," Hey, hey. I’ll decide if it’s no big deal."
Happy," Sounds like it’s no big deal, but remember, I’m watching you."
Liz, Everyone stick together.
 Harrington, Yeah.
Charles, You kidding me? This place is huge.
Flash, I’ve seen bigger.
Abe, There’s a bird in here.
Peter," (to Ned) Hey, you brought your laptop, right?"
Ned, Why?
Ned," Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?"
Peter," Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don’t really want Mr. Stark to know about it."
Ned, So you’re lying to Iron Man now?
Peter," No, I’m not lying. He just doesn’t really get what I can do yet."
Peter, Ah... Gotcha.
Peter," All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp."
Ned, There’s a ton of other subsystems in here...
Peter, Hmm?
Ned, (smirks) ...but they’re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.
Peter, What?
Peter, “Training Wheels Protocol?”
Peter, Turn it off.
Ned," I don’t think that’s a good idea. I mean, they’re probably blocked for a reason."
Peter," Come on, man. I don’t need training wheels."
Peter, I’m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It’s not cool.
Ned, But you are a kid.
Peter," Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands."
Ned," Peter, I just don’t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?"
Peter," Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on."
Ned, I really don’t think this is a good idea.
Peter, (whispers) The guy in the chair.
Ned, Don’t do that.
Peter, Come on.
Peter," Yeah, the glowy thing, it’s evidence. Keep it safe."
Peter, All right?
Ned," Okay, okay."
Peter, They’re moving.
Ned, Be careful.
Peter," Hey, Liz."
Liz," (whispers) Perfect timing. We’re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on, come on."
Peter, (whispers) What?
Sally," Hey, Peter."
Cindy, Hi.
Peter, Hey!
Peter," I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center."
Liz," Peter, you don’t need to study. You’re, like, the smartest guy I’ve ever met."
Liz," And besides... Um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale."
Peter, Hmm?
Liz," Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so, I-I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book."
Peter," Wow, you really... This is really important to you."
Liz," Yeah. It’s our future. I’m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, eleven dollars. So get your trunks on and come on."
Charles, Come on.
Sally, Come on.
Liz," I’m coming, I’m coming."
Suit Lady," Good evening, Peter."
Peter, Hello? Hello?
Suit Lady, Congratulations on completing the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol and gaining access to your suit’s full capabilities.
Peter," Ah, thank you."
Suit Lady, So where would you like to take me tonight?
Peter," (stuttering) S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He’s a bad guy."
Suit Lady, Tracker located.
Suit Lady, Plotting course to intercept target.
Peter," Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it’s fine."
Suit Lady, One hundred meters from destination and closing.
Suit Lady, Jump now.
Suit Lady, Detecting three individuals.
Peter, (whispers) Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That’s so lame.
Peter," Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?"
Suit Lady, Do you want to hear what they’re saying?
Peter," I can hear what they’re saying? Uh, yeah."
Suit Lady, Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Mason, I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is all my design.
Peter," Whoa, that’s so cool."
Randy, Can’t believe they’re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess.
Schultz," I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich."
Mason, Target inbound.
Peter," Whoa, they’re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I’m gonna get a little closer so I can see what’s happening."
Suit Lady, Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
Peter," Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah."
Suit Lady, Activating Instant Kill.
Peter," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don’t want to kill anybody!"
Suit Lady, Deactivating Instant Kill.
Schultz, Did you hear that?
Peter, What the hell just happened? What was that?
Suit Lady, You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.
Peter," Suit lady, what’s wrong with my web-shooters?"
Suit Lady, Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.
Peter, Why would I need rapid-fire?
Suit Lady, Would you like to see more options?
Suit Lady, You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.
Peter," Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it."
Inside the car,]
Schultz, You two wait right here.
Mason," Wait. You’re gonna want to turn on the dampers, though, or that thing will shatter your arm."
Schultz, All right. Where’s the dampers?
Peter, That one.
Suit Lady, Great choice.
Suit Lady, Would you like me to set this as your new default?
Peter," No, no, no."
Mason, Push that in.
Schultz, Right here?
Mason," No, no, the other-"
Schultz, This one right here?
Mason," Yeah, push. [Peter runs behind the gas station, away from the truck, and leaps on some trucks to reach the roof of the building.]"
Peter, What was that?
Suit Lady, Taser webs.
Peter, Taser webs? I don’t want taser webs.
Suit Lady, You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course?
Peter," No, just... You choose."
Suit Lady, Sure thing.
Inside the DODC convoy truck,]
DODC Central, Six-Alpha-Niner. Are you running on time?
DODC Driver," Copy, Central. Six-Alpha-Niner on schedule."
Schultz, I have visual.
Mason," Green light, green light."
Peter," Oh, that’s him."
Vulture," Okay, I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose."
Mason, Deploy anchors.
Vulture, Dropping down.
Mason, No outgoing distress signals. You’re all clear.
Vulture, Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.
Peter," Whoa, cool. It’s some kind of matter phase shifter."
Vulture," Alright, coming up."
Peter," Hey, Big Bird! This doesn’t belong to you!"
Peter," Oh, god."
Peter," Suit lady, what was that?"
Suit Lady, You told me to choose.
Peter," What? No, just set everything back to normal."
Suit Lady, Activating all systems.
Peter," Oh, my head."
Suit Lady, You appear to have a mild concussion.
Peter," Hey, so where am I right now?"
Suit Lady, I’m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors.
Peter," Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We’re gonna have to fight our way out of this one."
Peter," Three, two, one!"
Peter," What is this place? Suit lady, where am I?"
Suit Lady, You’re in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard. The Damage Control Deep Storage Vault.
Peter, No. Seriously?
Suit Lady, The door will most likely remain closed until morning.
Peter, (disappointed) Morning?
Peter," Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you “suit lady,” you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that’s... that’s weird."
Peter, What about Karen?
Suit Lady, You can call me Karen if you would like.
Peter," Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?"
Peter, What?
Peter, Maybe we should run that refresher course.
Karen, Ricochet web.
Peter, Ricochet web.
Peter, Whoa! Cool.
Karen, Splitter web.
Karen, Web grenade.
Peter, Web grenade!
Peter, Should I tell Liz that I’m Spider-Man?
Karen, Who is Liz?
Peter," Who is Liz? She’s.. heh. She’s the best. She’s awesome. She, uh, she’s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it’s kind of weird, you know? “Hey, I’m... I’m Spider-Man.”"
Karen, What’s weird about that?
Peter," What if she’s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she’d be when she sees me."
Karen," Well, if I were her, I wouldn’t be disappointed at all."
Peter," Thanks, Karen. It’s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?"
Karen, Thirty seven minutes.
Peter, What? Thirty seven minutes?
Peter, That’s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here.
Peter, There’s got to be something in here I can use.
Peter," Okay, let’s see."
Peter, Nope.
Peter, That’s awesome. [The Ultron head makes a clanging sound as it is discarded on the floor. Peter holds a purple glowing object.]
Peter," Ah, hey, it’s like the glowy thing."
Karen, That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.
Peter," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we’ve been carrying around a bomb?"
Karen, It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.
Peter," No, no, no, no, no."
Peter," Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock."
Peter, Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.
Karen, Trial unsuccessful.
Peter," Okay, we’re just gonna have to try every sequence."
Student," Ned, Peter, we’re gonna be late. Come on, let’s go."
Ned," Okay, hold on, hold on."
Karen, Initiating trial 247.
Peter, It worked! It works!
Moderator, Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.
Security, Thank you.
Peter," Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible."
Karen, Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Peter, Right across the street from the Washington Monument.
Ned," Hey, it’s Ned. Leave a message."
Peter," Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!"
Karen, There’s a vehicle approaching on your right.
Moderator, We have now entered sudden death.
Moderator, The next correct answer wins the championship.
Moderator, Midtown Tech?
Michelle, Zero.
Moderator, That is correct. Midtown takes the championship!
Student, We won!
Liz," You guys, I am so proud of you."
Flash, Told you we didn’t need Peter.
Ned," Flash, you didn’t answer a single question."
 Harrington," Taking it all in, Michelle?"
Michelle," Oh, yeah, I just... um, I don’t really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves."
 Harrington," Oh, I’m sure the Washington Monument wasn’t built by-"
 Harrington, Okay. Enjoy your book.
Michelle, Thanks.
Peter," Oh, Ned, you’re alive!"
Ned," (whispers) Peter, are you okay?"
Peter," Ned, Ned, where’s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?"
Ned," Don’t worry, it’s safe. It’s in my backpack."
Peter," No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous."
Ned, You missed the Decathlon. I covered for you.
Peter," Ned, listen to me!"
Ned, We’re at the Washington Monument now. You gotta- [Liz takes the phone from Ned.]
Liz," Peter, is that you?"
Peter," Oh, hey, Liz."
Karen, Is that Liz?
Peter, Please put Ned back on the phone.
Karen, You should tell her how you feel.
Liz," You freak! You are so lucky we won. You know, I want to be mad, but I’m more worried. Like, what is going on with you?"
Peter," Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It’s really important!"
Security," Miss, all items on the belt, please."
Peter," Liz, there’s something in Ned’s backpack! It’s really dangerous. Don’t let it go through an X-ray."
Peter, Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Flash," Hey, Mr. Harrington, can I be the one to tell Peter he’s expelled?"
Tour Guide," The Washington Monument is 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone."
Tourist, Did you hear that?
Peter," No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what’s going on up there?"
Karen, The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.
Peter," Oh, no."
Michelle, My friends are up there!
Peter," What? Uh... Don’t worry, ma’am. Everything’s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that’s tall."
Charles," Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling."
Liz," Just stay calm, everyone."
Abe," Oh, we are all going to die here."
Karen, Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.
Inside the elevator,]
Charles, We're freakin' screwed.
Tour Guide," Okay guys, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working."
Karen, The safety systems are completely failing.
Tour Guide, We're very safe in here.
Outside the Monument,]
Karen, The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.
Peter, I'm going as fast as I can!
Park Ranger, Let's go. Give me your hand.
Karen, You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.
Peter, What? Why?
Karen, Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.
PETER Peter, How do I get in there?
KAREN Karen, Activating reconnaissance drone.
Peter," Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That’s awesome."
Karen, Locating optimal entry point.
Karen, Proceed to southwest window.
Peter," Karen, I'm on my way."
Peter, Ah!
Peter," Okay. Oh, my god. Okay."
Karen, What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating?
Peter," It’s fine. It’s just, I've just never been this high before."
Karen," You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal."
Peter," Perfect. Oh, my god."
Peter, Why is it not breaking?
Karen, It's a four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.
Police, This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself.
Peter, My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!
Police, Return to the ground immediately.
Inside the elevator,]
 Harrington," Okay, who's next?"
Flash," Me, it's my turn!"
Ned," Flash, seriously? What are you doing?"
Flash, Come on.
Cindy, Don't worry about the trophy.
Students, Ah!
Police, Stand down! Return to the ground immediately!
Police, Return to the ground or we will open fire!
Police," (to the pilot) Go up, go up!"
Peter, I got this.
Flash, Take my trophy!
Police, This is your last chance!
Peter," Oh, I'm gonna die."
Peter, Break!
Ned, Ahh!
Peter, I did it! Whoa!
Peter," Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you."
Ned, Yes! Yes!
Peter," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around."
Ned," Sorry, sir. So sorry."
Park Ranger," Let's go, let's go!"
Park Ranger," Okay, okay."
Cindy," Mr. Harrington, go. Ned, come on."
Peter, Alright. This is your stop.
Ned," Come on, Liz."
Peter," Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!"
Liz, Are you sure it’s safe?
 Harrington, Liz!
Peter, You’re okay. You’re okay.
Peter, Okay.
Students," Oh, my god. Good, good."
 Harrington," Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. Come on in."
Peter," So, uh, is everyone okay?"
Karen," This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her."
 Harrington, Thank you.
Flash, Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
Mason," I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck..."
Toomes," Ugh, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?"
Mason," Yeah, but then that's it."
Mason," Oh, maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal."
Toomes, Would you shut up about that?
Mason, It's only one job.
Toomes, No.
Toomes," Eight years, not a word from the Feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built. Really?"
Toomes, I’m gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...
Schultz, I found him.
News Anchor," Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown."
Liz, Mom.
Doris, It’s okay. Alright.
May, Peter?
Families," Come here, come here. Oh, my god."
Jason," This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death."
Abe, (yells) Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screamin’.
Charles," (excited) There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere, It was..."
Charles, ...just like a bon Jovi concert.
 Harrington," As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing. I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again."
Jason," Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the Spider-Man."
Betty," (awkwardly) Thank you, Spider-Man."
Jason, Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit?
Ned," Dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?"
Peter," Crazy, dude."
Ned, It’s crazy. Should we tell everyone?
Peter, No.
Ned, Should I tell everyone?
Peter," No, dude, no, that’s not a good idea."
Ned," Okay, come on, we'll be late to class."
Peter, I’m not going to class.
Ned, You’re already in so much trouble for ditching the Decathlon.
Peter," Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control. And what he takes from Damage Control, that’s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him."
Ned, But we have a Spanish quiz.
Peter," Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so when I bring this guy in-"
Ned," Dude, you want to be a high school dropout?"
Peter, I am so far beyond high school right now.
Principal Morita," Parker, my office."
Steve, So... You got detention. You screwed up.
Steve," You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules."
Steve, We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong...
Coach Wilson," (indifferently) Hey, where you going? Get back here."
Steve," Just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?"
Coach Wilson, (to Michelle) Why are you here? You don't even have detention.
Michelle," Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis."
Michelle, Heh. It's you.
Steve," So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels."
Peter, May?
Peter," Hey, Karen. What's up?"
Karen," Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?"
Peter," Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate."
Karen, I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.
Peter, Footage?
Karen," Yes, Peter. I record everything you see."
Peter, Everything?
Karen, Everything.
Peter, Like all the time?
Karen, It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.
Peter," Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday."
Karen, With pleasure.
Peter," (on video)Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you."
Peter," No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day."
Peter," (on video) It is I, Thor, son of Odin!"
Peter," No, no, no, no, no, no. That's definitely... no. That's definitely not what we wanted to watch. Just..."
Karen, Your impressions are very funny.
Peter, Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Peter," Okay. The two on the right, who are they?"
Karen, Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals.
Peter, Nothing?
Karen," One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens."
Peter, Let's pay him a visit.
Karen, Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Peter," Uh, yeah."
Peter, Remember me?
Aaron," Uh, hey..."
Peter, I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.
Aaron," All right, chill."
Peter, Come on!
Aaron, What happened to your voice?
Peter," What do you mean, what happened to my voice?"
Aaron, I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.
Peter," I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man."
Aaron," I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl..."
Peter," I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else."
Aaron," You ain't ever done this before, huh?"
Peter, Deactivate interrogation mode.
Peter," Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half..."
Aaron, You know Delmar's?
Peter," Yeah, best sandwich in Queens."
Aaron, Sub Haven's pretty good.
Peter, It's too much bread.
Aaron, I like bread.
Peter," Come on, man, please."
Peter," Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again."
Aaron," The other night, you told that dude, ""if you shoot somebody, shoot me."" It's pretty ballsy. I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here."
Peter, Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?
Aaron," Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don't know who he is or where he is."
Aaron, I do know where he's gonna be.
Peter, Really?
Aaron," Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with, he's supposed to be doing a deal with him."
Peter, Yes! Yes. Thank-
Aaron, Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.
Peter," Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just..."
Peter, Yeah. Where is it?
Aaron, Can I give you some advice?
Peter, Hmm?
Aaron, You got to get better at this part of the job.
Peter, I don't understand. I'm intimidating.
Aaron," Staten Island ferry, eleven."
Peter," Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours."
Aaron," No, no, no, no. Come fix this."
Peter, Two hours. You deserve that.
Aaron, I got ice cream in here.
Peter," You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal."
Peter, (grunts) Nice.
Peter," Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode."
Karen, Sure thing.
Toomes, He’s up front. Main deck.
Schultz, I hate this guy.
Peter," It’s the guy from the bridge, right? Who’s that other guy?"
Toomes, Just keep me posted.
Karen, There’s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Peter. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?
Peter, I can’t talk right now. I’ll call her back.
Peter," Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can’t let anybody get away this time."
Peter, Who’s the guy on the left?
Karen," Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?"
Peter," No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already."
Schultz, White pickup truck.
Peter," Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck."
Peter," Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place."
Karen, Incoming call from Tony Stark.
Peter," No, no, no. No, no, don’t answer."
Tony, Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
Peter," Uh, I’m actually at school."
Karen," No, you’re not."
Tony, Nice work in D.C.
Peter, Okay.
Tony, My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I’m just trying to break the cycle of shame.
Peter," Uh, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now."
Tony," Don’t cut me off when I’m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-"
Tony, What is that?
Peter," Uh, I’m at band practice."
Tony, That’s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What’s up?
Peter," I gotta go. Uh, end call."
Tony, Hey.
Peter, I’ll take those! (snatches a key chain) Yoink!
Peter," Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10:30. You missed it."
Randy, Spider guy’s here.
Peter," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast."
Peter, Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.
Peter, I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing.
Peter," I’m honestly, I’m, I’m shocked."
Peter," Wait, what do you mean, FBI?"
Karen, The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Peter," I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here?"
Peter, Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Peter," Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!"
Toomes, Get to the top deck. We’re getting out of here.
Peter, Activate Taser Web!
Toomes, You’re messing with things you don’t understand.
Peter," Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points."
Peter, Web grenade. Web grenade.
Peter," Splitter web, go."
Karen," Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful."
Peter, Ninety-eight?
Man," Yeah, Spider-Man!"
Peter," No, no, no, no!"
Peter, No!
Peter, What the hell?
Peter, What the hell...
Tony," Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?"
Man," Yeah, Iron Man!"
Peter," Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?"
Tony, I think you’ve done enough.
Schultz is walking toward Vulture in the warehouse when he speaks out,]
Toomes," So that’s it, you’re just gonna run?"
Schultz," Feds were waiting for us. Now we’re on Iron Man’s radar? Yeah, I’m running. You should, too."
Toomes, You know I can’t do that.
Schultz, So now what?
Toomes," Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?"
Mason, Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this.
Toomes, (to Schultz) You in?
Tony," Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do."
Peter, Is everyone okay?
Tony, No thanks to you.
Peter, No thanks to me?
Peter," Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn’t listen. None of this would’ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you’d actually be here."
Tony," I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid."
Peter, I’m fifteen.
Tony," No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? ‘Cause that’s on you. And if you died, I feel like that’s on me. I don’t need that on my conscience."
Peter," Yes, sir."
Tony, Yes.
Peter," I, I’m sorry."
Tony, Sorry doesn’t cut it.
Peter, I understand. I just wanted to be like you.
Tony," And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it’s not working out. I’m gonna need the suit back."
Peter, For how long?
Tony, Forever.
Tony," Yeah. Yeah, that’s how it works."
Peter," No, no, no... Please, please, please..."
Tony, Let’s have it.
Peter, You don’t understand. Please. This is all I have. I’m nothing without this suit.
Tony," If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad."
Peter, I don’t have any other clothes.
Tony," Okay, we’ll sort that out."
Peter, (whispers) Hey.
May, I’ve been calling you all day. You didn’t answer your phone. You can’t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I’ve called five police stations.
May, Five. I called five of your friends.
Peter, I’m fine.
May, I called Ned’s mother.
Peter," May, I’m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I’m fine."
May," You. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That’s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what’s going on. Just lay it out. It’s just me and you."
Peter, I lost the Stark internship.
May, What?
Peter, Yeah.
May, What happened?
Peter," I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up."
May," Oh... It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay."
Peter, I’m sorry I made you worry.
May, You know I’m not trying to ruin your life.
Peter," Yeah, I know."
May, Just... I used to sneak out too.
Peter, Yeah.
May, And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage.
Peter, I know.
Principal Morita," Peter, you’re a good kid and you’re a smart kid. So just try to keep your head straight, okay?"
Peter, Okay.
Principal Morita, All right. Get out of here.
Ned, Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th where the principal has a crossbow?
Peter," Pretty sure that’s an urban myth, and no, I’m not expelled."
Ned, You’re so lucky.
Peter, Me gusta hacer la tarea. (I like doing homework.)
Spanish Teacher," Muy bueno, señor Parker. (Very good, Mr. Parker.)"
Peter, Hey.
Liz, Hey.
Peter, I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Liz," Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff."
Peter," Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-"
Liz," It’s fine. Last week, Decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died."
Peter," No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially... (sighs) ...because... I like you."
Liz, I know.
Peter, You do?
Liz, You’re terrible at keeping secrets.
Peter," (smiles) Yeah, you’d be surprised."
Peter," I got to get to class, but, um, I’d say we should hang out, but I’m gonna be in detention for..."
Liz, Uh-huh.
Peter," ...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming."
Liz," Actually, I was so busy planning it I never really got around to that part, so..."
Peter," Uh, do you want to go with me?"
Liz, (smiles) Yeah. Sure.
Peter," Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool."
Liz, Cool.
Peter, I’m actually going that way.
Peter," May, I need your help."
May, Right?
May," It’s game day. So, what’s the plan?"
Peter, Open the door for her.
May, Mm-hmm.
Peter," Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that’s creepy."
May, Don’t be creepy.
Peter," No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I’m putting my hands on her hips. I got this."
Peter, Love you.
May, Bye.
Toomes, You must be Peter.
Peter, Yeah.
Toomes, I’m Liz’s dad. Put her there.
Toomes, Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on.
 Suddenly,]
Doris," Hi, Peter. You look very handsome."
Peter, Thank you.
Doris, (whispers) You got his name right?
Toomes, Freddie?
Doris, Peter.
Toomes," Peter, Peter."
Doris, I’m gonna go get Liz.
Peter, Okay.
Toomes," You all right, Pete?"
Peter, Yeah.
Toomes," Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that?"
Peter, I’m not old enough to drink.
Toomes, That’s the right answer.
Toomes, Wow.
Toomes," Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful."
Liz," Please don’t embarrass me, Dad."
Toomes," Doesn’t she, Pete?"
Peter," Yeah, you look really good."
Toomes," Once again, that’s the right answer."
Liz, Is that a corsage?
Liz, Thanks.
Toomes," Well, hey, I’m your chauffeur, so, uh, let’s get this show on the road."
Doris," No, no, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect."
Liz, Mom.
Doris," Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer."
Doris, Smile. There you go.
Peter," Sir, you don’t have to drive us."
Toomes," No, no, it’s not a big deal. I’m going out of town. It’s right on my way."
Doris, He’s always coming and going.
Toomes, Last time.
Doris, Have fun.
Liz, Thank you.
Toomes, Promise.
Doris, (whispers) He’s cute.
Liz, Shh.
Toomes, See you in a couple of days.
Doris," Bye, baby."
Toomes, All right.
Toomes," Come on, Pedro."
Doris," Bye, Peter. Have fun."
Peter," Yeah, I will."
Toomes," What are you gonna do, Pete?"
Peter, What?
Toomes," When you graduate, what do you think you’re gonna do?"
Peter," Oh, um, I don’t know."
Liz," Don’t grill him, Dad."
Toomes," Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school, you pretty much have your life planned out, right?"
Peter," Yeah, no, I’m just a sophomore."
Liz, Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. So I think he doesn’t have to worry.
Toomes, Really?
Liz, Mm-hmm.
Toomes, Stark?
Liz, So cool.
Toomes, What do you do?
Peter," Yeah, actually, I don’t intern for him anymore."
Liz, Seriously?
Peter," Yeah, it got, um... boring."
Liz, It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.
Toomes, Really? Spider-Man? Wow. What’s he like?
Peter," Yeah, he’s nice. Nice man. Solid dude."
Toomes, Hmm.
Liz," Look, so cute."
Peter, Aww...
Toomes," I’ve seen you around, right? I mean... Somewhere. We’ve, uh, have we ever? Because even the voice..."
Liz," Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me."
Toomes, Oh.
Liz, And he was at my party.
Toomes, Ah.
Peter," It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows."
Liz," You were there for, like, two seconds."
Peter, That was... I was there longer than two seconds.
Liz, You disappeared.
Peter," No, no. I did not disappear."
Liz," Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C., too."
Toomes," That’s terrible, what happened down there in D.C., though. Were you scared?"
Toomes," I’ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?"
 then,]
Peter," Yeah, well, I actually didn’t go up. I saw it all from the ground."
Liz, Yeah.
Peter, Very lucky that he was there that day.
Toomes, (grins) Good old Spider-Man.
Liz," Dad, the light."
Toomes, Here we are. End of the line.
Liz," Thanks, Dad."
Toomes," You head in there, gumdrop. I’m gonna give Peter the, uh, the “dad talk.”"
Liz, (to Peter) Don’t let him intimidate you.
Liz, Love you.
Toomes," Love you, gumdrop."
Liz, Have a safe flight.
Liz, Hi! You guys look so pretty.
Toomes, Does she know?
Peter, Know what?
Toomes, So she doesn’t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I’ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn’t want my daughter to date...
Toomes," Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter’s life. I could never forget something like that. So I’m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don’t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I’ll kill you and everybody you love. I’ll kill you dead. That’s what I’ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?"
Toomes," Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?"
Peter, Thank you.
Toomes," You’re welcome. Now, you go in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good."
Liz, Hey. What did he say to you?
Peter," Gotta go. I’m, I’m sorry. You don’t deserve this."
Schultz, He gave you a choice. You chose wrong.
Peter," Ah, what the hell?"
Schultz, What’s with the crappy costume?
Peter, My web-shooters...
Schultz," I wasn’t sure about this thing at first, but damn."
Peter, Ugh. Gross.
Peter, Why did he send you here?
Schultz, Guess you’ll never know.
Peter, Nice shot!
Peter," Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz’s dad."
Ned, What?
Peter," I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He’s Mr. Stark’s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me."
Ned, Are you gonna be okay?
Peter," Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town."
Flash," I’m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino’s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So..."
Peter," (in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone."
Flash," Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad’s car, sir. So I can’t..."
Peter," (in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?"
Ned, Go for Ned.
Peter," Ned, I need you to track my phone for me."
Ned," Yeah, but where is it?"
Ned," Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue."
Peter," Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I’m in Flash’s car."
Ned, I’ll pull the specs.
Peter," Okay, you’re on speakerphone."
Ned, You stole Flash’s car. Awesome.
Peter," Yeah, it’s awesome. It’s awe... Whoa!"
Peter," Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!"
Ned," Peter, are you okay?"
Peter, I’ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...
Peter," Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?"
Ned, Yeah. I’m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Ned, Guy in the chair.
Happy, Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?
Ned," Uh... Mr. Happy, it’s Ned."
Happy, Who?
Ned, I’m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-
Happy, You gotta be shitting me.
Ned, Damn.
Peter," Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?"
Ned," Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise."
Peter," Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where’s my phone now?"
Ned, Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
Peter, What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!
Ned," Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don’t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes."
Peter, What?
Ned, He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.
Peter, Boxes? It’s moving day. It’s moving day! It’s moving day! He’s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!
Happy," All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony’s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap’s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor’s magic belt."
Ned," Okay, slow down. You’re getting close. It’s on your right."
Peter, What?
Ned, Turn right! Turn right!
Ned," Peter, are you okay?"
Peter, Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
Ned," It’s been an honor, Spider-Man."
 Warren, What are you doing here? There’s a dance.
Ned, Uh...
Ned, (awkwardly) I’m... looking... at... porn.
Peter, Hey! Surprised?
Toomes," Oh, hey, Pete. I didn’t hear you come in."
Peter, It’s over. I’ve got you.
Toomes," You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn’t sure. I thought, “Really?” But I get it now."
Peter, How could you do this to her?
Toomes," To her? I’m not doing anything to her, Pete. I’m doing this for her."
Peter," Huh, yeah."
Toomes," (sighs) Peter, you’re young. You don’t understand how the world works."
Peter," Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong."
Toomes," How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don’t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don’t care about us. We have to pick up after ‘em. We have to eat their table scraps. That’s how it is. I know you know what I’m talking about, Peter."
Peter, Why are you telling me this?
Toomes, Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.
Toomes," I’m sorry, Peter."
Peter, What are you talking about? That thing hasn’t even touched me yet.
Toomes," True. Then again, wasn’t really trying to."
Mason," Chief, they’re powering up engines."
Toomes, Okay.
Mason," Come on, come on, come on."
Toomes," Yeah, yeah."
Peter," Oh, god. Okay, ready?"
Peter," Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I’m down here. I’m down here. I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I can’t move. I can’t..."
Tony," If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it."
Peter," Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!"
Mason, Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.
Toomes," Oh, yeah."
Tech, Retro-reflective panels engaged.
Toomes," Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance."
Mason, It’s probably just a drag on the new turbines.
Peter, Ah! Whoa!
Mason, Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.
Peter," Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
Mason, Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.
Toomes," This better work, Mason."
Mason," Trust me, boss. Even one of those boxes and we are set for life."
Toomes, Yeah.
Peter, Hey! Ah! Whew.
Mason, You have thirty seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.
Toomes, Cloning transponder signal.
Mason, Launching decoy drone.
Toomes, Entering new coordinates.
Happy," Good, so it’s on its way?"
Tech," Yes, sir, right on course."
Happy," Okay, thank you. All right."
Toomes, Hot dog.
Peter, Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend’s dad.
Peter," Oh, god!"
Peter, Whew. I can’t believe that worked.
Mason," Chief, chief, they’re losing altitude. Get out of there."
Toomes, I’m not going home empty-handed.
Peter," Oh, my god."
Mason, Get out of there! What are you doing?
Peter, Please turn! Please turn!
Toomes," Hey, Pedro."
Toomes, Bingo.
Peter, Your wing suit. Your wing suit’s gonna explode!
Toomes," Time to go home, Pete."
Peter, I’m trying to save you!
Peter, No.
 A note is attached beside him, “FOUND FLYING VULTURE GUY. SPIDER-MAN. P.S. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE.” Happy raises his head and looks around as if searching for someone.]
Ned," It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, “Zzzz,” and you were like, “Ah!”"
Peter, Shh.
Ned," And then I just hit him with the “pew.” It was so, oh, my god."
Peter, You saved me. It was awesome.
Peter," Hey, Liz!"
Betty, I’m gonna miss you.
Liz, Bye.
Peter, Liz.
Peter," Liz, look. I’m so sorry."
Liz, You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?
When Peter fails to answer,]
Liz, The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Peter," Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can’t imagine what you’re going through. If there’s anything I can do to help..."
Liz," (fighting tears) I guess we’re moving to Oregon. Mom says it’s nice there, so that’s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn’t want us here during the trial, so..."
Peter," Liz, I... I..."
Liz," Bye, Peter. Whatever’s going on with you, I hope you figure it out."
 Harrington," Congratulations, Decathlon national champions."
Decathlon Team, (clapping) Yeah!
 Harrington," I’m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I’m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I’m appointing Michelle."
Decathlon Team, Yeah!
Michelle," Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J."
Ned, I thought you didn’t have any friends.
Michelle, I didn’t.
 He picks the broken phone up and reads a message from an unknown number, “Go to the bathroom.”]
Peter, I... I gotta go.
Michelle," Hey, where you going?"
Michelle," What are you hiding, Peter?"
Michelle," I’m just kidding. I don’t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills."
Ned, Yeah.
Peter," Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?"
Happy," I really owe you one. I don’t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-"
 Finally,]
Peter," So, uh, how long you been here?"
Happy, Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.
Peter, (whispers) Is he here too?
Happy," In the toilet? No, he’s upstate."
Peter," Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?"
Happy," Yeah, let’s go."
 Dashboard display says, “You may take your hands off the steering wheel.”]
Happy," Take a look. It’s pretty impressive, huh?"
Happy, They just finished remodeling the whole thing.
Happy, You don’t see that every day.
Tony," Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?"
Happy, Good.
Tony, Give me a minute with the kid.
Happy, Seriously?
Tony, Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.
Happy, I’ll be close behind.
Tony, How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.
Tony," Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn’t you think? Don’t you think?"
Peter," Yeah, yeah, I guess."
Tony, Let’s just say it was.
Peter," Mr. Stark, I really-"
Tony," You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team."
Peter, To the... To the team?
Tony," Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There’s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers."
Tony, When you’re ready... Why don’t you try that on? And I’ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.
Peter, I...
Tony, Yeah. Give that a look.
Tony," So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where’s he between? He’s next to Vision?"
Happy," Yeah, Vision’s not big on doors."
Tony, It’s fun.
Happy, Or walls.
Tony, (to Peter) You’ll fit right in.
Peter," Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I’m good."
Tony, You’re good? Good? How are you good?
Peter," Well, I mean, I’m... I’d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody’s got to look out for the little guy, right?"
Tony," You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?"
Peter, No.
Tony," Okay. It’s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?"
Happy, Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.
Peter," Thank you, Mr. Stark."
Tony," Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well."
Peter, See you around.
Tony, Okay.
Peter," That was a test, right? There’s, uh, nobody back there?"
Tony," Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck."
Peter," Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you."
Tony," Yeah, thank you."
Happy, Told you he’s a good kid.
Pepper, Where’s the kid?
Happy, He left.
Pepper, Everybody’s waiting.
Tony, You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.
Pepper, Did you guys screw this up?
Tony, (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.
Pepper, Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?
Tony," Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?"
Happy," Do I... I, uh..."
Tony, The engagement ring?
Happy, Are you kidding? I’ve been carrying this since 2008.
 then,]
Tony, Okay.
Pepper, I think I can think of something better than that.
Tony," Well, it would buy us a little time."
Tony, Like we need time.
Pepper, I can’t believe you have that thing in your pocket.
Tony," Want me to get the door for you, hon?"
Pepper, I got it.
Peter," Aunt May, did you do dinner already?"
 Peter calls out,]
Peter, May?
May, What the fu...?
Gargan," Look who it is! What are the odds you and I’d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It’s not on you. It’s on our, uh... little spider friend. I’ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is."
Toomes," If I knew who he was, he’d already be dead."
Guard," Toomes, your family’s here."
Steve, Hi. I’m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it’s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.
Steve, How many more of these?
Thanos," [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of “Thor: Ragnarok”.] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [grabs Thor by the head.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM."
Thor, [exhaustedly spitting blood from his mouth] You talk too much.
Thanos," [to Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference."
Loki," Oh, I do. Kill away!"
Loki," [cringing and looking away from his brother's pain and has just thought for a few seconds] ALRIGHT, STOP!"
Thor, We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
Thor," You really are the worst, brother."
Loki," [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother, the Sun will shine on us again."
Thanos," Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian."
Loki," Well, for one thing: I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk."
Ebony Maw, Let him have his fun.
Heimdall, Allfathers... let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.
Thanos, That was a mistake.
Thor, NO!!! You're going to die for that!
Ebony Maw," Shhhh. [Holding the Tesseract, on one knee] My humble personage... bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp."
Thanos," There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan."
Proxima Midnight," Father, we will not fail you."
Loki," [Emerging from a separate section of the ship] If I might, interject... If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
Thanos, If you consider failure experience...
Loki," I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos. I, Loki, Prince of Asgard... Odinson... The rightful King of Jotunheim, God of Mischief, do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity."
Thanos, “Undying.” You should choose your words more carefully.
Loki," [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You... will never be... a god. [Thanos snaps Loki's neck, killing him]"
Thanos, No resurrections this time.
Thor, No... Loki...
Doctor Strange, Seriously? You don't have any money?
Wong, Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
Doctor Strange, I'll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical Ham on Rye.
Wong," Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200."
Doctor Strange, Dollars?
Wong, Rupees.
Doctor Strange, Which is?
Wong," Uh, buck and a half."
Doctor Strange, What do you want?
Wong, I wouldn't say no to a Tuna Melt.
Bruce Banner, Thanos is coming. He's coming...
Doctor Strange," [Sharing a look with Wong, now in his normal fighting attire] ... Who?"
Title Screen, Avengers: Infinity War)
Tony," Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding. Pepper Potts: [laughing slightly] You're totally rambling."
Tony," No, I'm not."
Pepper Potts, Lost me.
Tony," Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?"
Pepper Potts, Yeah.
Tony," Okay, and then you're like, “Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?” “Oh! Someone's watching.” “I'm gonna go in my pants.”"
Pepper Potts," Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee."
Tony, Yes.
Pepper Potts, Yeah. Everybody has that.
Tony," Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"
Pepper Potts, [Nodding in understanding] Right.
Tony, Morgan! Morgan.
Pepper Potts," So you woke up, and thought that we were..."
Tony, Expecting.
Pepper Potts, Yeah.
Tony, [Becoming excited] Yes?
Pepper Potts, [Shaking her head} No.
Tony, I had a dream about it. It was so real.
Pepper Potts," If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that."
Tony," I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles."
Pepper Potts," It's not helping your case, OK?"
Tony," No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-"
Pepper Potts, {Insistently] You don't need that.
Tony," I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future, us, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know..."
Pepper Potts, Shirts?
Tony, You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Pepper Potts, You should have shirts in your closet.
Tony, Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Winston. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Tony, I will. (Tony kisses Pepper.)
Doctor Strange," Tony, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way."
Tony," I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?"
Doctor Strange," We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
Tony, And who's “we”?
Bruce Banner," [Emerges behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony."
Tony, [Looking surprised] Bruce.
Bruce Banner, Pepper.
Pepper Potts, Hi.
Tony, You okay?
Wong," [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurdling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence."
Doctor Strange, Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
 Tony," Tell me his name again. Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets, he takes what he wants, he wipes out half the population. He sent Loki! The attack on New York, that's him! Tony: [Speaking to himself] This is him...What's our timeline? Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe! If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony... Doctor Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of."
Tony," [Leans against a cauldron, stretching casually] Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?"
Doctor Strange, Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Tony, Is that what this is...?
Tony," [Looking offended] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?"
Doctor Strange, No can do.
Wong, We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony," And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so..."
Doctor Strange, Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony, It's not bad.
Doctor Strange, A bit chalky.
Wong, “A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge” is our favorite.
Bruce Banner, That's a thing?
Tony, Whatever. Point is: Things change.
Doctor Strange, Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony," And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us."
Doctor Strange," Well, if we don't do our jobs."
Tony," What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?"
Doctor Strange," Protecting your reality, douchebag."
Bruce Banner," Okay, guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is that we have the Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now."
Tony," [awkwardly] Yeah, that's the thing."
Bruce Banner, What do you mean?
Tony," Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline."
Bruce Banner," What?! Tony, you lost another super bot?!"
Tony, I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Doctor Strange," Who could find Vision, then?"
Tony, Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
Doctor Strange," [sighing in exasperation] Oh, great."
Tony, Maybe. But...
Bruce Banner, [missing the events of Civil War] Call him.
Tony," It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?"
Bruce Banner, No.
Tony, The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Bruce Banner, Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony, Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner," Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."
Tony," Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?"
Doctor Strange," [Trying to look up at one of his stray hairs fluttering] ... Not at the moment, no. [Tony looks at the opening on the ceiling and sees metal scraps flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum and scans the chaotic surroundings. He helps a woman up.]"
Tony, You okay?
Tony," Help him! Wong, Doc."
Bruce Banner, Go! Got it!
Tony," [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?"
Tony," Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!"
Doctor Strange, Might wanna use it.
Peter Parker," [Tapping his friend from the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
Ned Leeds, Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!
Stan Lee, What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?
Tony," F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
Ebony Maw," Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..."
Tony," I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
Ebony Maw, [Looks at Strange] Stone keeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?
Doctor Strange, Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you're trespassing in this city and on this planet.
Tony, It means get lost Squidward!
Ebony Maw, He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone.
Tony," Banner, you want a piece?"
Bruce Banner," No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?"
Tony, That's right.
Tony," Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
Bruce Banner," I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man."
Tony, Where's your guy?
Bruce Banner, I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
Tony, There's no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner, I know.
Tony, That's the thing right there. Let's go.
Tony," {Glances at Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
Bruce Banner," Tony, I'm sorry. (STAMMERS) Either I can't or he won't-"
Tony," It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
Wong, I have him.
Bruce Banner, Damn it.
Bruce Banner, Where'd that come from?
Tony, It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
Doctor Strange," Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..."
Tony," Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
Doctor Strange, It stays with me.
Tony, Exactly. Bye.
Bruce Banner," Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?"
Tony," Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?"
Bruce Banner, I'm trying. He won't come out.
Tony, Hammer. [Pushing Bruce out of the way]
Bruce Banner," [begins hitting himself]Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? Come out! Come out! Come out!"
Hulk, No!
Bruce Banner," What do you mean, “no”?"
Peter Parker," Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?"
Tony," Kid, where'd you come from?"
Peter Parker, Field trip to MoMA.
Peter Parker," What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?"
Tony, He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Ebony Maw, Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
Doctor Strange, It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
Ebony Maw, Then I'll take it off your corpse.
Doctor Strange, You'll find...removing a dead man's spell... Troublesome.
Ebony Maw, You'll only wish you were dead. [Strange falls unconscious and is Maw moves to grab him. The Cloak of Levitation flies Strange away} No!
Tony," [As Strange passes through the park] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it."
Peter Parker, On it!
Peter Parker, Not cool!
Peter Parker, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
Tony," Hang on, kid. [As Black Dwarf jumps towards Tony he is sent through a portal. Tony turns towards Wong, the one who made the portal} Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Tony begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Tony's feet thrusters turn morph together into a larger one] Unlock 17-A. [a pod jettisons from the New Avengers Facility] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you."
Peter Parker," But you said save the wizard! [Peter, based on lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!"
Tony, You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Peter Parker, Yeah! That makes sense.
Peter Parker," Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!"
Tony," Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
Y, Yup.
Peter Parker," Oh, come on!"
Y," Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
Pepper Potts," Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?"
Tony," Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
Pepper Potts, Why?
Tony, [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for awhile.
Pepper Potts, Tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony, Yeah.
Pepper Potts," God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship."
Tony," Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
Pepper Potts," Come back here, Tony. I swear to God..."
Tony, Pep...
Pepper Potts, Come back here right now! Come back!
Y," Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too..."
Peter Parker, Oh my God. I should have stayed on the bus.
Bruce Banner, Where you going?
Wong, The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
Bruce Banner, [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.
SPACE, Guardians of the Galaxy)
Peter Quill," (While dancing to the song) Sing it, Drax!"
Rocket, (After yawning briefly) Why are we doing this again?
Gamora," (In annoyance) It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying."
Rocket," I get that, but why are we doing it?"
Peter Quill, ‘Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Gamora, Which isn't the point.
Peter Quill, (Points at Gamora) Which isn't the point... I mean... If he doesn't pony up...
Rocket, We'll take his ship.
Peter Quill, B-b-b-bingo!
Mantis, (Adjusting a few things on the ship) We are arriving.
Peter Quill," All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. (Looks back at Groot is playing a video game) Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. Groot."
Groot, (Now a teenager and playing a handheld gaming device) [in a mocking tone] I am Groot!
Peter Quill, Whoa!
Rocket, Language!
Gamora, Hey!
Drax, Wow.
Peter Quill," You got some acorns on you, kid."
Rocket," Ever since you got your little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!"
Mantis, What happened?
Rocket, Looks like we're not getting paid.
Rocket, (Waving his hands) Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
Peter Quill, How the hell is this dude still alive?
Drax," He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man."
Peter Quill, I'm muscular.
Rocket," Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat."
Peter Quill," Yeah, right."
Drax, It's true. You have gained a little weight... (Drax motions to his chin and belly)
Peter Quill," What? Gamora, do you think I'm..."
Mantis, He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax, It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
Peter Quill, Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket," You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?"
Gamora, It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
Peter Quill, Stop massaging his muscles. Wake him up.
Mantis, Wake.
Thor, Who the hell are you guys?
Gamora," The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre..."
Drax, Including my own.
Gamora," If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. (she snaps her fingers)"
Thor, You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax, Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor, Your father killed my brother.
Peter Quill," Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. (Thor softens a bit.)"
Thor," Families can be tough. Look. Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain."
Peter Quill," And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-”"
Thor," I need a hammer, not a spoon... (he attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe... Maybe a birth date or something..."
Peter Quill, What are you doing?
Thor, Taking your pod.
Peter Quill," No, you're not! (mimics THOR's accent) You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
Rocket, Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
Peter Quill, No.
Drax, You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
Peter Quill, No I'm not.
Mantis, He just did it again!
Peter Quill, This is my voice!
Thor, (Thor stepping closer to Quill) Are you mocking me?
Peter Quill, Are you mocking me?
Thor, Stop it. You did it again.
Peter Quill, He's trying to copy me.
Thor, Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
Gamora, Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor, Knowhere.
Mantis, He must be going somewhere.
Peter Quill," No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. (To Thor as he rummages through there food stores)"
Thor, Not anymore.
Gamora, Thor... Why would he go to Knowhere?
Thor," Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector."
Peter Quill," If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."
Thor, Or a genius.
Gamora, (To Thor) How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Thor," There's six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers."
Peter Quill, The Avengers?
Thor, They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis, Like Kevin Bacon?
Thor," ...He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome."
Gamora, Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor," Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nidavellir."
Drax, That's a made up word.
Thor, All words are made up.
Rocket," Nidavellir is real? (Climbing on to the table) Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
Thor," The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you."
Rocket, Rabbit?
Thor," Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. (To ROCKET) I assume you're the captain, sir?"
Rocket, You're very perceptive.
Thor, You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
Rocket," Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go."
Thor, Wonderful.
Peter Quill, Except that I'm the captain.
Rocket, Quiet!
Peter Quill, And that's my backpack.
Rocket," Quill, sit down."
Peter Quill," (To Thor) Look, this is my ship. And I'm not going to... Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?"
Thor, The Thanos killing kind.
Peter Quill, Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
Thor, No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket, Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
Thor, A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora," If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop."
Thor, He already is.
Rocket," I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool."
Thor, So cool.
Peter Quill, (To Rocket) For the record... I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Rocket," You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain. (As he enters the pod) Come on, Groot. Put that game down. You'll rot your brain."
Thor," I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye."
Vision, (Holding his hand to the Mind Stone in pain)
Wanda Maximoff, Vis? Is it the stone again?
Vision, It's as if it's speaking to me.
Wanda Maximoff, What does it say?
Vision, I don't... I don't know. But something... Tell me what you feel.
Wanda Maximoff, I just feel you.
Wanda Maximoff, So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision, What if I miss that train?
Wanda Maximoff, There is an 11.
Vision," What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?"
Wanda Maximoff, You gave Stark your word.
Vision, I'd rather give it to you.
Wanda Maximoff," There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
Vision," Not to each other. Wanda... For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. – I, I... I think..."
Wanda Maximoff, It works.
Vision, It works.
Vision, Then stay. Stay with me. (a pause) Or not. If I'm overstepping...
Wanda Maximoff, What are they?
Vision, What the stone was warning me about. I have to go.
Wanda Maximoff, No. Vision. If that's true... Then maybe going isn't the best idea.
Vision," Wanda, I... (CORVUS GLAIVE appears suddenly behind vision, stabbing him through the back.)"
Wanda Maximoff, Vision!
Vision, The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Wanda Maximoff, Is that even possible?
Vision, It isn't supposed to be. My systems are failing. I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
Wanda Maximoff, Vis!
Corvus Glaive," (to VISION) Give up the Stone, and she lives."
Wanda Maximoff, Hands off.
Wanda Maximoff," Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go."
Vision, Please. Please leave.
Wanda Maximoff, You asked me to stay... I'm staying.
Vision, Please.
Wanda Maximoff, Get up.
Proxima Midnight, (To GLAIVE) Get up.
Corvus Glaive, I can't.
Natasha Romanoff, We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
Proxima Midnight, You'll never get the chance again.
Sam Wilson, (To Vision) Can you stand?
Vision," Thank you, Captain."
Steve Rogers, Let's get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff," (Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda) I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances."
Wanda Maximoff, I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson," Where to, Cap?"
Steve Rogers, Home.
s Mother, (To Young Gamora) Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
Ebony Maw, Zehobereans...
Young Gamora, (As she is dragged away) Mother!
Ebony Maw," Choose a side, or die."
Young Gamora, Mother! (She pulls away from the one who is dragging her and punches him as he leaves)
Ebony Maw," One side, for reservation. The other, an honor..."
Thanos," What's wrong, little one?"
Young Gamora, My mother. Where is my mother?
Thanos, (Kneels down to Gamora) What's your name?
Young Gamora, Gamora.
Thanos," You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. (THANOS takes her hand and leads her to a pavilion, where he produces a small red-jeweled dagger) Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other... Here. You try."
Ebony Maw," Now go in peace, and meet your Maker."
Thanos, Concentrate. There! You've got it.
Peter Quill, Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the “blow off your junk” kind or the gas kind? ‘Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-
Gamora, I need to ask a favor.
Peter Quill," Yeah, sure."
Gamora," One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos."
Peter Quill, Which is what the grenades are for. (GAMORA silences him with a look.) I'm sorry. What's the favor?
Gamora, If things go wrong... If Thanos gets me... I want you to promise me... you'll kill me.
Peter Quill, (A beat. Confusion.): What?
Gamora, I know something he doesn't. If he finds out... The entire Universe could be at risk.
Peter Quill, What do you know?
Gamora," If I tell you, you'd know, too."
Peter Quill," If it's so important, shouldn't I?"
Gamora, Only if you wanna die.
Peter Quill, Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
Gamora," Just... trust me. And possibly, kill me."
Peter Quill," I mean, I'd like to. I really would...(GAMORA silences him by covering his mouth with her hand)"
Gamora, Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
Peter Quill, (beat) Okay.
Peter Quill, Dude! How long have you been standing there?
Drax, An hour.
Peter Quill, An hour? Are you serious?
Drax," I've mastered the ability, of standing so incredibly still... That I've become invisible to the eye. Watch."
Peter Quill, You're eating a zark nut
Drax, But my movement... So slow... And it's imperceptible.
Peter Quill, No.(Peter and Gamora shake their head)
Drax, I'm sure I'm invisible.
Mantis," Hi, Drax."
Drax, Damn it.
DRAX, I'm reading movement. From the third quadrant.
PETER QUILL," Yep. I'm picking that up, too."
QUILL, Let's put it down right here.
THANOS, Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection. I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.
COLLECTOR, I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
THANOS, I imagine it's like breathing for you.
COLLECTOR, Like suicide.
THANOS, So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
COLLECTOR, I didn't know what it was.
THANOS," Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, Tivan. Where's the Stone?"
DRAX, Today...
Peter Quill, Drax. Drax.
Drax, ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
QUILL," Drax, wait! not yet, not yet, not yet. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
DRAX, No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
MANTIS," Sleep. (DRAX is knocked out, causing a ruckus.)"
QUILL," Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... (GAMORA moves towards THANOS.) The other right!"
THANOS," Why? Why you? Daughter... (he falls down, holding his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound. GAMORA breaks down in tears.)"
QUILL, That was quick.
COLLECTOR, Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
THANOS," Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing. That is, it was. Now... Reality can be whatever I want."
GAMORA, You knew I'd come.
THANOS," I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one."
DRAX, Thanos!
QUILL," Let her go, Grimace!"
GAMORA, Peter...
QUILL, I told you to go right.
GAMORA, Now? Really?
QUILL, You let her go!
THANOS," Ah, the boyfriend."
QUILL, I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long term booty call. Let her go.
GAMORA, Peter...
QUILL, Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack of a chin right off your face!
GAMORA, Not him.
GAMORA, You promised! You promised.
THANOS," Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. (To PETER) She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. (he shoves GAMORA towards PETER's gun, egging him on.) Do it!"
QUILL, I told you to go right.
GAMORA," I love you, more than anything."
QUILL," I love you, too."
THANOS, I like you.
ROSS, Still no word from Vision?
RHODES, Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
ROSS, On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
RHODES," You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?"
ROSS," My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own."
RHODES," If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here."
ROSS," I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
RHODES, That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.
ROSS, You have second thoughts?
RHODES, Not anymore.
ROGERS, Mr. Secretary.
ROSS, You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
NATASHA, You could use some of that right now.
ROSS," The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?"
ROGERS," I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way... We'll fight you, too."
RHODES," All over it. (Turns off hologram) That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap."
ROGERS," You too, Rhodey."
RHODES," Well. You guys, really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years."
SAM," Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star."
BRUCE," Uh, I think you look great. Yeah. I'm back."
NATASHA," Hi, Bruce."
BRUCE, Nat.
SAM WILSON, This is awkward.
BRUCE," So we gotta assume they're coming back, right? And they can clearly find us. We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?"
NATASHA," After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families."
BRUCE, Who's Scott?
ROGERS, Ant-Man.
BRUCE," There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look... Thanos has the biggest army in the Universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... He gets...Vision's stone."
Natasha," Well then, we have to protect it."
VISION," No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps... Its molecular integrity could fail. (VISION addresses WANDA as he nears her)"
WANDA," And you, with it. We're not having this conversation."
VISION, Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
WANDA, That's too high a price.
VISION," Only you, have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him."
ROGERS," But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision."
VISION," (While walking toward Steve) Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?"
BRUCE," Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
WANDA, You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
BRUCE," I'm saying that... If we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts."
NATASHA, Can we do that?
BRUCE, Not me. Not here.
RHODEY," You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back."
ROGERS, (pause) I know somewhere.
Okoye," You'll have the King's Guard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted."
Challa, And the border tribe?
Okoye, Those that are left.
Challa, Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
Okoye, And what of this one?
Challa, This one may be tired of war. but the White Wolf has rested long enough.
BUCKY, Where's the fight?
CHALLA, On it's way.
Ebony Maw," In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. Give me... the stone."
TONY," Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
Peter Parker," Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty..."
Tony, What the-
Peter Parker, I know what you're gonna say.
Tony, You should not be here.
Peter Parker, I was gonna go home-
Tony, I don't wanna hear it.
Peter Parker, But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-
Tony, And now I gotta hear it.
Peter Parker," ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here."
Tony, (seriously) What did you just say?
Peter Parker, I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
Tony, Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker, No. I did think this through.
Tony, You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker," It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider – Man when there's no neighborhood. (Pause) Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say."
Tony, Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
Peter Parker," Um. Okay. Okay...uh...did you ever see that really old movie, Aliens?"
EBONY MAW, Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
EBONY MAW, ...could end your friend's life in an instant.
Tony," I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
EBONY MAW, You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
Tony," Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies."
Peter Parker, Yes! Wait what are those!
Peter Parker," Hey, we haven't officially met. (it ignores him and goes to Strange.) Cool."
Strange, We've gotta turn this ship around.
Tony, Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
Strange," No, I want to protect the stone."
Tony, And I want you to thank me. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Strange, For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
Tony, Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Strange, I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony, Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
Strange," Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you."
Tony," And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
Peter Parker, I'm backup.
Tony, No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
Strange," I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?"
Peter Parker," No. I'm peter, by the way."
Strange, Doctor Strange.
Peter Parker," Oh we're using our made-up names. Um...I'm Spider-Man, then."
Tony, This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Strange, Can we control it? Fly us home? (Tony doesn't make eye contact.) Stark?
Tony, Yeah.
Strange, Can you get us home?
Tony, Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
Strange, Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Tony," No. It's you who doesn't understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years...Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?"
Strange," (a pause) Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand...if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it."
Tony," Good. Nice. Moral compass.We're straight. (Turning to Peter, he puts his outstretched arm briefly on either shoulder) Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now."
Thanos, I thought you might be hungry.
Gamora, I always hated that chair.
Thanos, So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
Gamora, I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
Thanos, You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.
Gamora, I was a child when you took me.
Thanos, I saved you.
Gamora, No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Thanos, Going to bed hungry. scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
Gamora, Because you murdered half the planet.
Thanos, A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora, You're insane.
Thanos," Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, it's resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
Gamora, You don't know that!
Thanos," I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time...you had that same will...as you fought by my side. Daughter."
Gamora, I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
Thanos," And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."
Gamora, I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Thanos, I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. But because you did. And you lied.
Gamora, Nebula.
Gamora, Don't do this.
Thanos," Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."
Gamora, Please don't do this.
Thanos, And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
Gamora, Stop. Stop it. I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
Memory Nebula," You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them."
Memory Gamora, He can never get them all.
Memory Nebula, He will!
Memory Gamora," He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it."
Thanos, (To Gamora) You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?
Gamora, Vormir!
Gamora, The Soul Stone is on Vormir.
Thanos, Show me.
Groot, (Irritably) I am Groot.
Rocket, Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
Groot, (Still irritably) I am Groot.
Thor," (While looking out the window) Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again."
Rocket, You speak Groot?
Thor," Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
Groot, (shortly) I am Groot.
Thor, You'll know when we're there. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. (nostalgically) It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
Rocket," Okay, time to be the captain. (walks to a console near by Thor) So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying."
Thor," Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."
Rocket, And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor, Both dead.
Rocket," Still got a mom, though?"
Thor, Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket, A best friend?
Thor, Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket, Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor," (Smiling widely) Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."
Rocket," Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...He's the toughest there is."
Thor," Well, he's never fought me."
Rocket," Yeah, he has."
Thor," He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget."
Rocket, Better be some hammer.
Thor," You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of *morons* and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance."
Rocket, And what if you're wrong?
Thor, If I'm wrong then what more could I lose?
Rocket, I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. (Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person) Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. (He gives Thor the eyeball)
Thor, What's this?
Rocket, What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor, He gave you his eye?
Rocket, He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor," Thank you, sweet rabbit."
Rocket," Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!"
Thor, (Smacking his palm against the side of his head) I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket, It ain't the eye.
Thor, Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
Rocket, I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning...Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space...
Thor, This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...
Rocket," (Looking to a pedestal) You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?"
Thor, Yes. Why?
Rocket, Look anything like that?
Groot, I am Groot.
Rocket, Go back to the pod.
Thor," Eitri, wait! Stop! Stop."
Eitri, Thor?
Thor, What happened here?
Eitri, You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
Thor," Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do?"
Eitri," (He pauses before beginning his solemn story) 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. “Your life is yours.” he said “But your hands are mine alone.”"
Thor," Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."
Nebula," Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan."
Peter Parker," (To Tony) Hey, what's going on?"
Tony, I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function. (Instructing Peter to put his arm in the machine for piloting) Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
Peter Parker," Yep, got it."
Tony," This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
Peter Parker, Okay. Okay. Ready.
Tony, We might wanna turn.
Peter Parker, Turn! Turn! Turn!
Tony, (To Strange) You alright?
Tony, That was close. I owe you one.
Peter Parker," Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...And I end up eating you, I'm sorry."
Tony, (While pointing at Peter) I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Peter Parker, I'm trying to say that something is coming.
Drax, (Yelling) Thanos!
Peter Parker," (While crawling backward from Mantis) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!"
Lord," Stay down, clown."
Drax," (Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation) Die, blanket of death!"
Lord, Everybody stay where you are. Chill F out. (Quill powers off his helmet) I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?
Tony," Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?"
Drax, I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?
Lord," Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak."
Tony," Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! (Tony extends his nanotech gun)"
Drax," Do it, Quill! I can take it."
Mantis, No he can't take it!
Strange, She's right. You can't.
Lord, Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. (To Parker) Starting with you.
Strange," Wait, what, Thanos? All right, let me ask you this one time. What master do you serve?"
Lord, What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? “Jesus”?
Tony, You're from Earth?
Lord, I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Tony," Yeah, that's on Earth dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?"
Peter Parker," So, you're not with Thanos?"
Lord," With Thanos? (scoffs) No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait, who are you?"
Peter Parker," We're the Avengers, man."
Lord, Oh.
Mantis, You're the ones Thor told us about.
Tony, You know Thor?
Lord," Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving."
Tony, Where is he now?
Rocket, This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
Eitri," It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost."
Thor, Did it have a name?
Eitri, Stormbreaker.
Rocket, That's a bit much.
Thor, So how do we make it?
Eitri, You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor," Rabbit, fire up the pod."
Quill, The *heck* happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
Tony," Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just need the gauntlet."
Tony," Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?"
Drax," I stopped listening after you said, “We need a plan.”"
Tony," (To Quill) Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page."
Quill," See, “not winging it” isn't really what they do."
Peter Parker," Uh, what exactly do they do?"
Mantis," Kick names, take ass."
Drax," (Quietly as he shifts to a commanding position beside Mantis) Yeah, that's right"
Tony," (Tony stands for a moment with an expression of hopelessness) Alright, just get over her, please. Mr. Lord can you get your folks to circle up?"
Quill, “Mr. Lord.” Star-Lord is fine. (Motions to Drax and Mantis)
Tony, We gotta coalesce. ‘Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude..”
Quill," Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what is means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plans, and that way it might be really good."
Drax, Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony, What dance-off?
Quill, It's nothing.
Peter Parker," Like in Footloose, the movie?"
Quill, (Excitedly) Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Peter Parker, It never was.
Tony," Don't encourage this, alright?"
Peter Parker, Okay.
Tony, We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Quill," Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. (Quill points at Stark and Parker) So that 50% of me that's stupid... That's 100% you."
Tony, Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis," Excuse me, but...Does your friend often do that?"
Tony," Strange, we alright?"
Tony, You're back. You're alright. Hi.
Peter Parker," Hey, what was that?"
Strange, (Speaking breathlessly) I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
Quill, How did you see?
Strange," 14,000,605."
Tony, How many did we win?
Strange, One.
Thanos, The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.
Stonekeeper," Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros. Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
Thanos, You know us?
Stonekeeper, It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos, Where's the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper, You should know...It extracts a terrible price.
Thanos, I am prepared.
Stonekeeper, We all think that at first. (The figure glides farther out of the shadows and reveals the face of who we know to be Red Skull from Captain America: The First Avenger) We are all wrong.
Thanos, How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull," A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
Red Skull, What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
Thanos, What's this?
Red Skull, The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
Thanos, Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull, To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos, Of what?
Red Skull, In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.
Gamora," All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
Thanos, (Turning to face Gamora with tears in his eyes) No.
Gamora, Really? Tears?
Red Skull, They're not for him.
Gamora, No. This isn't love.
Thanos," I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. I'm sorry, little one."
Gamora, No!
Sam," Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0. I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to."
Okoye, (Walking with T'Challa and a band of the King's Guard) When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.
Challa, And what did you imagine?
Okoye, The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
Bruce Banner, (To Rhodey) Should we bow?
Rhodes," Yeah, he's a king."
Steve Rodgers, Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. (Shaking hands with T'Challa)
Rhodes, What are you doing?
Challa," Uh, we don't do that here. (He dissuades with a motion of his hand) So how big of an assault can we expect?"
Bruce Banner," Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault."
Steve Rodgers, How we looking?
Challa," You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and..."
Bucky," (Walking forward toward Steve) A semi-stable, 100-year-old man."
Steve," How you been, Buck?"
Bucky," Uh, not bad, for the end of the world."
Shuri, Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce," Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially."
Shuri, Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
Bruce," (Staring for a moment) Because, we didn't think of it."
Shuri, (smiling) I'm sure you did your best.
Wanda, Can you do it?
Shuri," Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. (To T'Challa) It will take time, brother."
Steve, How long?
Shuri, As long as you can give me.
Okoye, (Looking at a device that just alerted her) Something's entered the atmosphere.
Sam," (Over the comm) Hey, Cap, we got a situation here."
Bucky," God, I love this place."
Sam," Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome."
Vision, (Appearing beside the window with the others) It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha," (Turning toward Vision) Vision, get your *rear* back on the table."
Challa, We will hold them off.
Steve," (To Wanda) Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head...you blow it to hell."
Wanda, I will.
Challa, Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. (He points to Steve) And get this man a shield.
Rocket, I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic.You wanna get them moving...You're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.
Thor, Leave that to me.
Rocket," Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-"
Thor," More power, rabbit!"
Eitri," Well done, boy."
Thor, That's Nidavellir.
Eitri, *Dang* it.
Rocket, “*Dang* it.”? What's “*dang* it?
Eitri, The mechanism is crippled.
Thor, What?
Eitri, With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
Thor, How long will it take to heat?
Eitri," A few minutes, maybe more. Why?"
Thor, I'm gonna hold it open.
Eitri, That's suicide.
Thor, So is facing Thanos without that axe.
Natasha," How we looking, Bruce?"
Bruce," (While walking) Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually- (He stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands) I'm okay. I'm okay."
Sam, We got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
Challa, Thank you for standing with us.
Baku," (Translated) Of course, brother."
Natasha, Where's your other friend?
Proxima, You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve, That's not gonna happen.
Challa, You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
Proxima," We...Have blood to spare. (She raises her right arm with a cry, and several large ships emerge from the forest behind her.)"
Bucky, Did they surrender?
Steve, Not exactly.
Bucky, What the hell?
Natasha, Looks like we pissed her off.
Okoye, (Watching as the Outriders bombard the dome only a few getting through) They're killing themselves.
Sam, (Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies) You seen the teeth on those things?
Rhodes," Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. (He flies over a section that has been breached and drops a barrage of mines)"
Sam," Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision."
Steve, Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
Okoye, (To T'Challa) How do we do that?
Challa," We open the barrier. (Putting his hand to his ear) On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen."
Wakandan Officer," Requesting confirmation, My King. You said open the barrier?"
Challa, On my signal.
Baku, (To Okoye) This will be the end of Wakanda.
Okoye, Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
Challa," Wakanda Forever! (He crosses his hands over his chest as his Black Panther helmet covers his face, leading the army as they run toward the barrier. T'Challa and Steve are at the front of the advancing army) Now! (The section in the barrier disappears and the Outriders charge at them)"
Challa," How much longer, Shuri? (Over the comm)"
Shuri," We've barely begun, brother."
Challa, You might want to pick up the pace.
Thor," Allfathers, give me strength."
Eitri," You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you."
Thor, Only if I die.
Eitri, Yes. That's what killing you means.
Eitri," Hold it! Hold it, Thor!"
Rocket," (Kneeling over Thor) Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? (To Eitri) I think he's dying."
Eitri," He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!"
Bruce, [laughing with joy] Hah! Hah! Hah! You guys are so screwed now!
Thor," BRING ME THANOS!!! (He charges toward the hoards of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket)"
Strange," Oh, you're much more of a Thanos."
Thanos," I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
Strange, You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos," And where do you think he brought you? (Star-Lord is near by behind wreckage with his weapon ready, and Spiderman is above the structure where Strange sits."
Strange, Let me guess. Your home?
Thanos," (Smiling reminiscently) It was. And it was beautiful. (Thanos uses the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed) Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
Strange, Genocide.
Thanos," But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. (The illusion fades into the true state of Titan)"
Strange, Congratulations. You're a prophet.
Thanos, I'm a survivor.
Strange, Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos," With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...Mercy."
Strange, And then what?
Thanos, I finally rest...And watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange, I think you'll find our will (Using his hand motions) equal to yours.
Thanos," Ours? (He looks up in time to a see a chunk of wreckage coming down on him, and tries to use the Power to stop, but is too late)"
Iron Man," (Flying in) Piece of cake, Quill."
Quill," (Flying in from the other side) Yeah, if your goal was to *tick* him off."
Lord, Boom!
Strange, (To the Cloak of Levitation) Do not let him close his fist.
Man, Magic. (He kicks him in the head) More magic.
Man, Magic with a kick! (He kicks him again in the head with his right leg)
Man, Magic with a-
Thanos," Insect! (He then throws him, about to use the gauntlet, but is interrupted by an explosion caused by Iron Man shooting a missile at him. As the flames blind Thanos, Spiderman attaches a web to him, and strains against it. Thanos pulls Spiderman toward him, but looks up as a ship crashes beside him, and Nebula jumps in front of him)"
Thanos," Well, well."
Nebula, You should have killed me.
Thanos, It would've been a waste of parts!
Nebula," [she runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!"
Iron Man, [while pulling on the gauntlet] Is he under? Don't let up.
Mantis, [starting to cry] Be quick... He is very strong!
Iron Man," Parker, help! Get over here. [Parker withdraws his web, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go. We gotta open his fingers to get it off!"
Lord," [lands, then joins with the others] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where's Gamora?"
Thanos, ... My... Gamora...?
Lord," Oh, bull–shit. Where is she?"
Mantis, [shocked] He is in anguish!
Lord, Good.
Mantis, [crying] He... he... he mourns!
Drax, What does this monster have to mourn?!
Nebula, [she suddenly understands in horror what Thanos has done with...] Gamora.
Lord, ... What?
Nebula, He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone...but she didn't.
Iron Man," Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, understand?"
Iron Man," Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!"
Lord, Tell me she's lying. [enraged] ASSHOLE!!! Tell me you didn't do it!!!
Thanos, I... had... to.
Lord," [while starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't... No, you didn't... [he continues to rage and then proceeds to pistol-whipping Thanos in the face] NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!"
Drax, Quill!
Iron Man," [to the struggling Quill] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!"
Man, It's coming! It's coming! I got it! I got it...!!
Man," [seeing Mantis flying] Oh, God! [he jumps and hugs her, extending his spider legs which give them a safe landing]"
Stonekeeper," Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros, Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
Thanos, You know us?
Stonekeeper, It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos, Where is the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper, You should know: it extracts a terrible price.
Thanos, I am prepared.
Stonekeeper, We all think that at first. [his face is revealed as the Red Skull] We are all wrong.
Thanos, How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull," A lifetime ago, I too sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here, guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
Gamora, I was a child when you took me.
Thanos, I saved you.
Gamora," No, no, we were happy on my home planet."
Thanos," Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps? Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise."
Gamora, Because you murdered half the planet!
Thanos, A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora, You're INSANE.
Thanos," Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources ... finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correcting."
Gamora, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!
Thanos," I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only who the will to act on it."
Rocket, You speak Groot?!
Thor," Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
Groot, I am Groot?
Thor, You'll know when we're close. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the blazing power of a Neutron Star. It's the birthplace of my hammer; it's truly awesome.
Rocket," [to himself] Okay, time to be the Captain. [to Thor] So, dead brother, huh? That can be annoying."
Thor," Well, he's been dead before. But this time... I think it really might be true."
Rocket, And you said that your sister and your dad...
Thor, Both dead.
Rocket," But, still got a mom, though?"
Thor, Killed by a Dark Elf.
Rocket, Best friend?
Thor, Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket, You sure you're up for this particular murder mission?
Thor," Absolutely. The rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret, they're all tremendous motivators. They truly clear the mind... so, I'm good to go."
Rocket," Yeah, but this is Thanos we're talking about, he's the toughest there is."
Thor," Well, he's never fought me."
Rocket," ... Yeah, he has!"
Thor," Well, he's never fought me twice. And I'll have a new hammer, don't forget."
Rocket," Well, it'd better be some hammer."
Thor," You know, I'm one thousand and five hundred years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one of them would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because Fate wants me alive. Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."
Rocket, And what if you're wrong?
Thor," Well, if I'm wrong, then... what more could I lose?"
Gamora," All my life I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now, you kill and torture and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
Thanos, [sheds a tear] No.
Gamora, Really? Tears?
Red Skull, They are not for him.
Gamora, No. This isn't love.
Thanos, I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.
Thanos," [anguished] I'm sorry, Gamora."
Gamora, [muted] NO!
Banner, Who's Scott?
Steve Rogers, Ant-Man.
Banner, There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?!
Stark, [to the Guardians] We gotta work together. Because if all we come out with is a plucky attitude...
Quill," Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. We're more optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except...it sucks. So, let me do the plan and that way...it might be really good."
Drax, Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Stark, What dance-off?
Quill, It's not a thing.
Parker, Like in Footloose? The movie?
Quill, Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Parker, It never was.
Stark, Don't encourage this alright we're not getting any help from Flash Gordon.
Quill," Flash Gordon? That's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. So that 50% of me that's stupid, that's 100% you."
Strange," Oh, yeah. You're much more of a “Thanos”."
Thanos," I take it that Maw is dead? This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
Strange, You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos, Where do you think he brought you?
Strange, Let me guess. Your home.
Thanos," It was. [activates the Reality Stone, showing a holographic image of a populated Titan] And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets; too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
Strange, Genocide?
Thanos," At random. Dispassionate, fair; To rich and poor alike. They called me a madman... and what I predicted came to pass."
Strange," Congratulations, you're a prophet."
Thanos, I'm a survivor.
Strange, Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos," With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers; They would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy."
Strange, Then what?
Thanos, I finally rest and watch the Sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange," [he summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think you'll find our wills equal to yours."
Thanos, Ours?
Stark," Piece of cake, Quill."
Quill," Yeah, if your goal is to piss him off!"
Tony, So this is it. It's all been leading to this.
Thor, Ready?
Steve Rogers, Let's go.
Gamora, He won't stop. Until he destroys half the universe. Everything you know... Everything you love... It will all be gone.
Peter Quill," Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan and that way it might be really good. Tony: Wow."
Thanos," The end is near. When I'm done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
 Thor," New haircut? I notice you've copied my beard. Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine. A tree. Groot: I am Groot. Steve Rogers: I am Steve Rogers."
Black Panther," Thank you for standing with us, M'Baku. M'baku: Of course, brother."
Black Panther," How much longer, Shuri?"
Bruce Banner," [trying to change into the Hulk] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. Hulk! Hulk! Hulk! [Hulk: NOOOO!] Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!"
Thor, I told you. You'd die for that!
Thanos, You should've... You... You should've gone for the head!!
Thor, NO!
Thanos, Daughter?
Gamora, Did you do it?
Thanos, Yes.
Gamora, [beat] What did it cost?
Thanos, [solemnly] ... Everything.
Thor, What did you do? [angrily] WHAT DID YOU DO?!
Captain America, Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
Bucky Barnes, [feeling his prosthetic arm turning into ash] Steve?
Challa," [while reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [he suddenly disintegrates into ashes and Okoye falls back on the ground, much to her anguish]"
Okoye, Hezvo...?!
Groot," [resting on a tree branch; slowly disintegrating, to Rocket] I am Groot... [Translation: “Dad?”]"
Rocket," [as Groot starts slowly to corrode into ashes, much to Rocket's horror] No... No. No. No. No! Groot... no."
War Machine," [searching for Falcon, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!"
Mantis, Something... is... happening. [she gets killed into ashes]
Drax, [to Quill; his right arm and lower-half of his body slowly turns to ashes] Quill...?
Tony," Steady, Quill."
Quill," Aw, man."
Strange," [calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [he finally gets erased]"
Parker, [feels himself starting to disintegrate and doesn't want to die] Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...
Tony, [trying to be calm] You're all right.
Parker," [stumbling] I don't know what's – I don't know what's happening. I don't – [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight and crying] Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mister Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry."
Nebula," [to Tony, seeing Thanos' victory] He did it."
War Machine, What is this? What the hell is happening?
Captain America," ... Oh, God."
Nick Fury, Still no word from Stark?
Maria Hill," No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [receives three beeps from her device]"
Fury, What is it?
Hill, Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
Fury, Same energy signatures as New York?
Hill, Ten times bigger.
Fury, Call Klein. We'll meet him at –
Hill, NICK!
Fury, They okay?
Hill, There's no one here.
Fury, Call control. Code Red!
Hill, [alerting Fury] Nick...?
Fury, Hill?
CLINT BARTON," Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?"
LILA BARTON, Mhm.
CLINT BARTON," Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]"
CLINT BARTON, Here. Can you see?
LILA BARTON, Yeah.
CLINT BARTON, You sure?
LILA BARTON, Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.]
CLINT BARTON, How about now?
CLINT BARTON, Alright. Ready your fingers.
COOPER BARTON, Nice.
LAURA BARTON," Nice throw, kiddo."
COOPER BARTON, You go.
LAURA BARTON," Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]"
LILA BARTON, Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
CLINT BARTON, Probably your brothers.
CLINT BARTON," Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]"
LAURA BARTON, Mayo or mustard?
NATHANIEL BARTON, How about ketchup?
LAURA BARTON, Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] I can do ketchup.
CLINT BARTON," Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow."
LAURA BARTON," Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!"
CLINT BARTON," Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?"
NEBULA," Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]"
Tony," You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That's a goal. We're now one apiece."
NEBULA, I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]
Tony, We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
Tony, That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]
Tony, And... you've won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]
Tony, Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] Have fun?
NEBULA, It was fun.
Tony," This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you."
Tony, Couldn't stop him.
STEVE ROGERS, Neither could I.
Tony, I lost the kid.
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, we lost."
Tony," Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]"
PEPPER POTTS," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]"
Tony, It's okay.
JAMES RHODES, It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures."
Tony, Where is he now? Where?
STEVE ROGERS, We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
Tony, What's wrong with him?
ROCKET," Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?"
Tony," Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear."
ROCKET, Maybe I am.
STEVE ROGERS," We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him."
Tony," Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight."
STEVE ROGERS, Okay.
Tony, He's unbeatable.
STEVE ROGERS," Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?"
Tony, Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus."
Tony," [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -"
RHODEY," Tony, Tony, Tony!"
Tony, Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
STEVE ROGERS," Well, that didn't work out, did it?"
Tony," I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers."
RHODEY, Okay.
Tony, Right?
RHODEY, You made your point. Just sit down.
Tony, Okay...
RHODEY, Okay?
Tony," Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?"
RHODEY," Tony, you're sick."
Tony," [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way."
RHODEY, Sit down. Sit.
Tony," We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve's face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar."
Tony," Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide."
STEVE ROGERS, Tony!
Tony, I'm fine. I...
RHODEY, Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.
CAROL DANVERS, You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Where are you going?
CAROL DANVERS, To kill Thanos.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile."
STEVE ROGERS," We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too."
RHODEY, You even know where he is?
CAROL DANVERS, I know people who might.
NEBULA," [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask ""where would we go once his plan was complete?"". His answer was always the same: ""To the Garden."""
RHODEY," That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan."
STEVE ROGERS, So where is he?
ROCKET," When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet."
NEBULA, Thanos is there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He used the stones again.
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know."
RHODEY," Look, he's still got the stones, so..."
CAROL DANVERS, So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.
RHODEY, Just like that?
STEVE ROGERS," Yeah, just like that."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
BRUCE BANNER," If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?"
CAROL DANVERS," Because before, you didn't have me."
RHODEY," Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?"
CAROL DANVERS," There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys."
Thor, I like this one. [smiles]
STEVE ROGERS, Let's go get this son of a bitch.
Title Screen, Avengers: Endgame]
ROCKET," Okay, who here hasn't been to space?"
RHODEY, Why?
ROCKET, You better not throw up on my ship.
NEBULA, Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
CAROL DANVERS, I'll head down for recon.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," This is gonna work, Steve."
STEVE ROGERS, I know it will.
STEVE ROGERS, Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
CAROL DANVERS," No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him."
NEBULA, And that's enough.
ROCKET, Oh no.
STEVE ROGERS, Where are they?
CAROL DANVERS, Answer the question!
THANOS," The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation."
BRUCE BANNER, You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]
THANOS, You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]
NATASHA ROMANONFF, Where are the Stones?
THANOS, Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER, You used them two days ago!
THANOS, I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.
RHODEY," We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying."
NEBULA, My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
THANOS," Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly."
ROCKET, What... What did you do?
THOR, I went for the head.
JOE RUSSO," So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about."
STEVE ROGERS, What did you talk about?
JOE RUSSO," Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads."
JIM STARLIN, What about you?
JOE RUSSO," I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so..."
STEVE ROGERS," That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us."
Screen Title, SAN FRANCISCO]
Scott Lang," (grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.) What the hell?"
Scott Lang, Hope?
Scott Lang, [yells] Kid! Hey kid!
Scott Lang, What the hell happened here?
Scott Lang," No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter's name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no."
Scott Lang," [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]"
Scott Lang, What?
SCOTT LANG, Cassie?
CASSIE LANG," Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]"
SCOTT LANG, You're so big!
ROCKET," Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged."
 respectively," Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]"
NEBULA, It was an infectious garbage scowl.
ROCKET," So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]"
CAROL DANVERS," Well, you were closer."
ROCKET, Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?
OKOYE, It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
OKOYE," Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?"
CAROL DANVERS, Not likely.
ROCKET," What, you gonna get another haircut?"
CAROL DANVERS," [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets."
ROCKET," [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point."
CAROL DANVERS, So you might not see me for a long time.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me."
ROCKET, Okay.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Alright.
CAROL DANVERS, [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Where are you?
RHODEY, Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, It's probably a rival gang.
RHODEY," Except it isn't. (Nat realizes something.) It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... (Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.) I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Will you find out where he's going next?
RHODEY, Nat...
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Please.
RHODEY, [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]
STEVE ROGERS, You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You here to do your laundry?
STEVE ROGERS, And to see a friend.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Clearly, your friend is fine."
STEVE ROGERS, You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, In the Hudson?
STEVE ROGERS," There's fewer ships, cleaner water."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]"
STEVE ROGERS," Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]"
STEVE ROGERS," You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," If I move on, who does this?"
STEVE ROGERS, Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
STEVE ROGERS, I think we both need to get a life.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Smiling] You first.
Scott Lang," Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me."
STEVE ROGERS, [Standing up] Is this an old message?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Also standing up] It's the front gate.
SCOTT LANG," Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys."
STEVE ROGERS, Scott. Are you okay?
SCOTT LANG, Yeah. I'm fine.
SCOTT LANG, Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Only to make conversation.
SCOTT LANG," Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
SCOTT LANG," Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours."
SCOTT LANG," See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving."
STEVE ROGERS," Scott, what are you talking about?"
SCOTT LANG," What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos."
STEVE ROGERS," Wait, are you talking about a time machine?"
SCOTT LANG," No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore."
SCOTT LANG, So who do we talk to about this?
 Tony, [Clapping his hand in a famous beat. Clap! Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap- Clap!] Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?
MORGAN STARK, Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's]
Tony," Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)"
MORGAN STARK, Okay.
Tony, There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
MORGAN STARK, No.
Tony, That's what you want. How did you find this?
MORGAN STARK, Garage.
Tony, Really? Were you looking for it?
MORGAN STARK," No. I found it, though."
Tony," You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her."
SCOTT LANG," (Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony) Now, we know what it sounds like..."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?"
Tony," Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?"
STEVE ROGERS, (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.
Tony," In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home."
SCOTT LANG, I did.
Tony," No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?"
SCOTT LANG, (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?
Tony," Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?"
SCOTT LANG, The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
Tony," Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?"
STEVE ROGERS, I don't believe we would.
Tony," Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise."
SCOTT LANG," Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -"
Tony," I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?"
SCOTT LANG, [embarrassed] No.
Tony, Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Tony... We have to take a stand.
Tony," We did stand. And yet, here we are."
SCOTT LANG," I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even..."
Tony," That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid."
MORGAN STARK, Mommy told me to come and save you.
Tony," Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance. Tony: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He's scared.
STEVE ROGERS, He's not wrong.
SCOTT LANG," Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?"
STEVE ROGERS," No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain."
SCOTT LANG," (Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house) Bigger than his?"
BRUCE BANNER," Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs."
SCOTT LANG, I'm so confused.
BRUCE BANNER, [seriously] These are confusing times.
SCOTT LANG," Right. No, no, that's not what I meant."
BRUCE BANNER," [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now."
SCOTT LANG, Yeah! Wh...How? Why?
BRUCE BANNER," Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," No one blamed you, Bruce."
BRUCE BANNER," I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds..."
GIRL," Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?"
BRUCE BANNER, Yes?
GIRL, Can we get a photo?
BRUCE BANNER," 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?"
SCOTT LANG," Oh, yeah."
BRUCE BANNER," Thanks, [To the Children] Say ""green""! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]"
BRUCE BANNER, Did you get that?
SCOTT LANG, [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
SCOTT LANG," They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does."
BRUCE BANNER," Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]"
BOY, Stranger Danger.
SCOTT LANG, He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.
BRUCE BANNER," But, come on, the kid! But he...but you..."
SCOTT LANG, I don't want a picture with them.
BRUCE BANNER, [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.
SCOTT LANG, I don't want it anymore.
BRUCE BANNER," No, no...you feel bad."
SCOTT LANG," Just take the goddamn phone. [Maybe next time, Scott.]"
GIRL," Thank you, Mr. Hulk."
BRUCE BANNER," No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. [Same time with kids] Hulk out!"
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER, [Awkwardly] Dab!
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER, Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
STEVE ROGERS, About we were saying...
BRUCE BANNER," Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too."
Tony," Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please."
Y, Processing...
Tony," Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second."
Y, Just a moment.
Tony, And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
Y, Model rendered.
Tony, Shit!
MORGAN STARK, Shit.
Tony," [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?"
MORGAN STARK, Shit.
Tony," No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her."
MORGAN STARK, Why you up?
Tony," 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind."
MORGAN STARK, Was it Juice Pops?
Tony," Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... [Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind."
Tony," You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wipes Morgan's lips and pushes her head onto her pillow] That face goes there."
MORGAN STARK, Tell me a story.
Tony," A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end."
MORGAN STARK, [Giggling] That's a horrible story.
Tony," Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]"
MORGAN STARK, I love you 3000.
Tony," [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That's crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night."
Tony," Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]"
Tony, [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?
PEPPER POTTS," Oh, it's just a book on composting."
Tony, [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?
PEPPER POTTS, Just -
Tony," I figured it out, by the way."
PEPPER POTTS," You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -"
Tony, Time travel.
PEPPER POTTS," [Amazed] What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying."
Tony, That's right.
PEPPER POTTS, We got really lucky.
Tony," Yeah, I know."
PEPPER POTTS, A lot of people didn't.
Tony," No, I can't help everybody."
PEPPER POTTS, It sort a seems like you can.
Tony," Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop."
PEPPER POTTS," Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life. [Tony smiles]"
Tony, I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
PEPPER POTTS, But would you be able to rest?
BRUCE BANNER," Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing."
STEVE ROGERS," Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby."
BRUCE BANNER," Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]"
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that!
BRUCE BANNER, Just... It was a bad joke.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," You were kidding, right?"
BRUCE BANNER," [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?"
SCOTT LANG, Perfectly not confusing.
STEVE ROGERS," Good luck, Scott. You got this."
SCOTT LANG," You're right. I do, Captain America."
BRUCE BANNER, On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!
TEEN SCOTT LANG," Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right."
STEVE ROGERS, What is this?
BRUCE BANNER, What's going on?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, That...who is that?
BRUCE BANNER, Hold on. [Panicking]
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is that Scott?
TEEN SCOTT LANG," Yes, it's Scott!"
OLD SCOTT LANG, Ow! My back!
STEVE ROGERS, What is this?
BRUCE BANNER, Can I get a little space here.
STEVE ROGERS, Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?
BRUCE BANNER," I'm working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]"
STEVE ROGERS, It's a baby. [seriously?]
BRUCE BANNER, It's Scott.
STEVE ROGERS, As a baby!
BRUCE BANNER, He'll grow.
STEVE ROGERS, Bring Scott back!
BRUCE BANNER," [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]
BRUCE BANNER, And... Kill it!
SCOTT LANG, Somebody peed my pants.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Oh thank god.
SCOTT LANG," But I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me...Or just ""me"" me."
BRUCE BANNER, [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!
BRUCE BANNER, What? I..I see this as an absolute win!
Tony, Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
STEVE ROGERS," Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?"
Tony," [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it."
STEVE ROGERS, You did.
Tony," Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there's the Tony we know] Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it."
STEVE ROGERS, Me too.
Tony," We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice."
STEVE ROGERS," Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.]"
STEVE ROGERS, Tony...
Tony," Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
STEVE ROGERS," Thank you, Tony."
Tony," Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?"
STEVE ROGERS, We're working on that right now.
ROCKET," Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?"
SCOTT LANG," Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome."
NEBULA," [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone."
SCOTT LANG," Oh, God!"
RHODEY," What's up, regular sized man?"
ROCKET, Kind of a step down from a golden palace and magic hammers and whatnot.
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]"
VALKYRIE, You shouldn't have come!
BRUCE BANNER," Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl."
VALKYRIE, [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
BRUCE BANNER, [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.
ROCKET, How you doin'?
VALKYRIE, [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.
BRUCE BANNER," That bad, huh?"
VALKYRIE," We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies."
BRUCE BANNER, It's that bad.
VALKYRIE, Yeah.
ROCKET, [Grimacing at the smell] What the... Woo! Something died in here.
BRUCE BANNER, Hello? Thor?
THOR, [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?
THOR," The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]"
BRUCE BANNER, Thor?
THOR," [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! [growling]"
ROCKET," No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary."
THOR," Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?"
KORG, Hey boys!
BRUCE BANNER," Hey guys, long time no see."
KORG," Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again."
THOR, NoobMaster.
KORG," Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead."
THOR," NoobMaster. Hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms and SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT! Oh, that's right, go cry to your father, you little weasel!"
KORG," [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor."
THOR," Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?"
KORG, Thank you very much. I will.
THOR," So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things."
BRUCE BANNER," Buddy, you all right?"
THOR," Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?"
ROCKET, [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.
THOR," [Laughs] So, what's up?"
BRUCE BANNER, We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
THOR," What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks."
BRUCE BANNER, Like Thanos.
THOR, Don't say that name.
KORG," Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here."
BRUCE BANNER," [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you."
THOR," Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off."
KORG, Umm... Stormbreaker?
THOR," Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?"
BRUCE BANNER," I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?"
THOR, I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
BRUCE BANNER, It was you. You helped me.
THOR," [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway."
BRUCE BANNER, I think we can bring them back.
THOR," Stop. stop, okay? [opens a packet on M&Ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we? [The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more]"
KORG," Nah, all good here, mate."
THOR," So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye."
BRUCE BANNER," [from offscreen] We need you, pal."
ROCKET, [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.
THOR," [pauses, but doesn't look up then puts the bottle down] What kind?"
SCREEN TITLE, TOKYO]
Romanized, Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It's him! He's after Akihiko!)
AKIHIKO, てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！(Romanized: Temē naze konna koto wo suru? Oretachi temē ni nani mo shitenē daro!) (English: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!)

RONIN, [Also in Japanese] お前はもう十分殺しただろ(Romanized:Omae mo jūbun korshita daro) You're done hurting people.
AKIHIKO, [Japanese]俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen and chuckles] (English: WE hurt people? You're crazy!)
AKIHIKO, [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] 死ね! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)
AKIHIKO, 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? (Romanized: Mate! Tasukete kure! Omae ni nan demo yaru! Nani ga hosī? (English: Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want?)
RONIN," [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me."
CLINT BARTON, You shouldn't be here.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON, I've got a job to do.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," We found something. A chance, maybe..."
CLINT BARTON, [Now openly crying] Don't...
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Don't what?
CLINT BARTON, ...don't give me hope.
NATASHA, I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
Tony," [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How's it going?"
ROCKET," It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal."
RHODEY, Time travel suit? Not bad.
SCOTT LANG," [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!"
BRUCE BANNER, I'm being very careful.
SCOTT LANG," No, you're being very Hulky."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm being careful.
SCOTT LANG," [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more."
RHODEY," Scott, calm down."
SCOTT LANG," Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run."
SCOTT LANG, All right. I'm not ready for this.
CLINT BARTON, I'm game. I'll do it.
BRUCE BANNER," Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it."
RHODEY," Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]"
BRUCE BANNER," [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible..."
RHODEY, [In a tone that says it's what we're all thinking.] It's Thanos.
BRUCE BANNER," ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future."
SCOTT LANG," Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved."
CLINT BARTON, Bingo.
NEBULA, That's not how it works.
CLINT BARTON," Well, that's what I heard."
BRUCE BANNER, What? By who? Who told you that?
RHODEY," [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -"
SCOTT LANG, Quantum Leap -
RHODEY," A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -"
SCOTT LANG, Hot Tub Time Machine -
RHODEY," Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel."
SCOTT LANG," Die Hard? No, it's not one..."
RHODEY, This is known.
BRUCE BANNER," I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future..."
NEBULA, Exactly.
SCOTT LANG, So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
BRUCE BANNER," [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!"
LILA BARTON, [offscreen] Cooper? Where are my headphones?
CLINT BARTON," [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]"
LILA BARTON," Yeah, Dad? [She looks around] Dad?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?"
CLINT BARTON," [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked."
STEVE ROGERS," Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones."
Tony, Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG," I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about."
BRUCE BANNER," Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history."
Tony," Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in."
CLINT BARTON, Which means we have to pick our targets.
Tony, Correct.
STEVE ROGERS," Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is he asleep?
RHODEY," No, I'm pretty sure he's dead."
THOR," Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence."
Tony, Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
THOR," I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you."
ROCKET, Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
SCOTT LANG, Is that a person?
ROCKET, Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG, A planet? Like in outer space?
ROCKET," Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space."
NEBULA, Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?
NEBULA," A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister."
SCOTT LANG, Not it.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, That Time Stone guy...
BRUCE BANNER, Doctor Strange.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?"
Tony, Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
BRUCE BANNER," Nice place in the village, though."
Tony, Yeah. Sullivan Street.
BRUCE BANNER, Hmm... Bleecker.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Wait, he lived in New York?"
Tony, No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York."
BRUCE BANNER, [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.
STEVE ROGERS," All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot."
STEVE ROGERS," Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck."
ROCKET,[Refers to Steve's speaking] He's pretty good at that.
SCOTT LANG, Right? [Looks very excited]
Tony," All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green."
BRUCE BANNER, Tractors engaged.
ROCKET," [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?"
CLINT BARTON," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best."
ROCKET," As promises go, that was pretty lame."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.
STEVE ROGERS," All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock."
 STEVE ROGERS, Feel free to smash a few things along the way.
BRUCE BANNER," I think it's gratuitous, but whatever."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.
BRUCE BANNER," That, actually."
BRUCE BANNER," Sorry, but I wasn't asking."
BRUCE BANNER," Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-"
THOR, That's Jane.
ROCKET," All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split."
THOR," I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups..."
ROCKET, Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
ROCKET, Who's the fancy broad?
THOR, It's my Mother. She dies today.
ROCKET, Oh. That's today?
THOR, I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.
ROCKET, Come here. [Standing in front of him]
THOR," No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-"
ROCKET, Come here. Right here.
ROCKET," You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?"
THOR, Okay.
ROCKET, Are you crying?
THOR, No...Yes!
ROCKET, Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?
THOR," Yes, I can."
ROCKET, Good.
THOR," I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this."
ROCKET," Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!"
RHODEY," Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down."
CLINT BARTON," Hey, can we hurry it up?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock."
RHODEY," All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Yeah.
RHODEY, Take that stone and come back. No messing around.
CLINT BARTON, [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.
RHODEY," Let's get it done. Yes, sir."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.
RHODEY, You guys watch each other's six.
CLINT BARTON, Yeah.
NEBULA, The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
CLINT BARTON, It's a long way from Budapest.
RHODEY," Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?"
NEBULA, [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
RHODEY," Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?"
NEBULA," My father, my sister... and me."
RHODEY, And you? Where are you right now?
Tony," Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. [Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.]"
STEVE ROGERS, Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.
Tony," Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass."
STEVE ROGERS," No one asked you to look, Tony."
Tony, [whispers] It's ridiculous.
SCOTT LANG," I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]"
SCOTT LANG, Who are these guys?
Tony," They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet."
SCOTT LANG," Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys."
Tony," You're small, but you're talking loud."
Tony," All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone."
SCOTT LANG, [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me.
Tony," All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor."
STEVE ROGERS, On it. Head to the lobby.
Tony, Alright. I'll see you there.
STEVE ROGERS, Change of plans.
STEVE ROGERS, Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.
STEVE ROGERS, We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.
STEVE ROGERS, That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear.] Hail Hydra.
Tony," Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time."
SCOTT LANG, Bombs away. [Sliding down to Tony's Arc Reactor] Is... is that Axe body spray?
Tony," Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?"
SCOTT LANG, I'm going inside you. Now.
HYDRA AGENT," Hand over the case, Stark."
Tony," [To present Scott through radio as he inhales sharply] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go."
SCOTT LANG, You promise me you won't die?
Tony, You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
SCOTT LANG, That doesn't sound mild.
Tony," Do it, Lang!"
Tony, Window's closing. Pull my pin!
SCOTT LANG, Here goes!
Tony," MEDIC! You guys, some help!"
Tony, Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
SCOTT LANG," That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?"
Tony," Oh, we blew it."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans.] Oh, you gotta be shitting me."
STEVE ROGERS, [Puts the case down] I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.
STEVE ROGERS," [Standing up] Yeah, I know. I know."
STEVE ROGERS, Bucky... is... alive!
STEVE ROGERS, That is America's ass.
BRUCE BANNER," Please, please!"
BRUCE BANNER," With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that."
BRUCE BANNER," No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, [Holds the Time Stone projection] in that reality, [puts it back to its spot] it never left."
BRUCE BANNER, We will. I will. I promise.
BRUCE BANNER," Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?"
BRUCE BANNER," Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos."
BRUCE BANNER, Yes!
BRUCE BANNER, I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
BRUCE BANNER, So he must have done it for a reason.
BRUCE BANNER, Thank you.
THOR, Aah!!!
THOR," OH, God!"
THOR," Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... [Trying to hide his belly]"
THOR, I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.
THOR," Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?"
THOR," [Pretending] Yes, I am."
THOR, I didn't say I'm from the future.
THOR," [voice breaking up] I am totally, totally from the future."
THOR, I really need to talk to you.
THOR, His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.
THOR," I guess, yeah."
THOR, That's a little bit harsh.
THOR," I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?"
THOR," I really missed you, Mum."
ROCKET, Thor! I got it!
THOR," Ma, I have to tell you something."
THOR, But this is about your future.
ROCKET," Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move."
THOR, I wish we had more time.
THOR," I love you, Mom."
ROCKET, Come on. We gotta go.
ROCKET, Three... two...
THOR," No, wait!"
ROCKET, [To Frigga] Wh- what am I looking at?
THOR, [Happy and a little bit surprised] I'm still worthy.
ROCKET," Oh, boy."
THOR," Goodbye, Mom."
RHODEY, So he's an idiot?
NEBULA, Yeah.
RHODEY, What's that?
NEBULA, The tool of a thief.
RHODEY," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything..."
NEBULA, What are you talking about?
RHODEY," When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–"
RHODEY, Okay. All right. Go ahead.
NEBULA, I wasn't always like this.
RHODEY," Me either. But we work with what we got, right?"
RHODEY, Sync up. [They both suit up.] Three.. two.. one...
NEBULA," No! He knows! [Runs back to the ship and gets on the comms.] Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows."
Tony, Cap–
Tony," Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem."
SCOTT LANG," Huh. Yeah, we do."
STEVE ROGERS," Well, what are we gonna do now?"
Tony," You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk."
SCOTT LANG, You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–
Tony," You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself."
SCOTT LANG, You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.
Tony," Dude, come on."
SCOTT LANG," You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–"
Tony, I dropped the ball.
SCOTT LANG, You ruined the time heist.
Tony, Is that what I did?
SCOTT LANG, Yeah!
STEVE ROGERS, Are there any other options with the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG," No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home."
STEVE ROGERS," Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either."
Tony," I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State."
STEVE ROGERS, When were they both there?
Tony, They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE ROGERS, How vague?
SCOTT LANG, What are you talking about? Where are we going?
Tony, I know for a fact they were there–
SCOTT LANG, Who's they? What are we doing?
Tony, And I know how I know.
SCOTT LANG," Guys, what's up? What is it?"
Tony," Well, it looks like we're improvising."
SCOTT LANG, Right. What are we improvising?
Tony," Scott, get this back to the compound."
Tony, Suit up.
SCOTT LANG, What's in New Jersey?
Tony," 0-4,"
STEVE ROGERS, 0-4– -
Tony," Uhh, 0-7."
STEVE ROGERS, 0-7. -
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me...
Tony, 1-9-7-0.
STEVE ROGERS, Are you sure?
SCOTT LANG," Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back."
Tony," Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. [To Steve] Do you trust me?"
STEVE ROGERS, I do.
Tony, Your call.
STEVE ROGERS, Here we go.
Tony," Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?"
STEVE ROGERS, The idea of me was.
Tony," Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?"
STEVE ROGERS, In plain sight.
Tony," [Leaving the elevator] Good luck on your mission, Captain."
STEVE ROGERS," [Waiting for another floor] Good luck on your project, doctor."
ELEVATOR LADY, You're new here?
STEVE ROGERS, Not exactly.
Tony, [Grabbing Tesseract] Gotcha. Back in the game.
HOWARD STARK," Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal."
Tony," Oh, yeah."
HOWARD STARK, I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?
Tony," Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul. [awkwardly bumps into a chair] Pardon me."
HOWARD STARK, Do I know you?
Tony," No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT."
HOWARD STARK, Huh. MIT. Got a name?
Tony, Uh– Howard.
HOWARD STARK," Well, that'll be easy to remember."
Tony, Howard– Potts.
HOWARD STARK," Well, I'm Howard Stark. [Holds out hand to shake.]"
Tony, Hi. [Holds Howard's finger]
HOWARD STARK," Shake it, don't pull it."
Tony, Yeah–
HOWARD STARK," You look a little green around the gills there, Potts."
Tony," I'm fine. Just, long hours."
HOWARD STARK," Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts."
Tony, Yeah. That would be swell.
HOWARD STARK, That way.
Tony, Okay.
HOWARD STARK, Need your briefcase?
HOWARD STARK," You're not one of those beatniks, are ya, Potts?"
HANK PYM, That would be the number that you called. Yes.
HANK PYM, Bring it up.
HANK PYM, I'm confused. I thought that was your job.
HANK PYM," They didn't open it, did they?"
HANK PYM, Excuse me! Out of the way!
Tony," So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?"
HOWARD STARK," My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too much time in the office."
Tony, Congratulations.
HOWARD STARK," Thanks. Hold this, will you?"
Tony," Yeah, sure. How far along is she?"
HOWARD STARK, I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.
Tony, I have a little girl.
HOWARD STARK, A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.
Tony, What'd be so awful about that?
HOWARD STARK, Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.
SECURITY OFFICER, And you've never seen these two men before?
ELEVATOR LADY," No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy."
SECURITY OFFICER, Can you describe them?
ELEVATOR LADY," Well, one of them had a hippie beard."
SECURITY OFFICER, Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
ELEVATOR LADY, Definitely Mungo Jerry.
SECURITY OFFICER," Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach."
Tony," So, where are you at with names?"
HOWARD STARK," Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo."
Tony," Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time."
HOWARD STARK, Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?
Tony, Wildly. Yeah.
HOWARD STARK, Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?
Tony," I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–"
HOWARD STARK," My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt."
Tony," I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl."
HOWARD STARK, Yeah? Like what?
Tony," ""No amount of money ever bought a second of time."""
HOWARD STARK, Smart guy.
Tony, He did his best.
HOWARD STARK," Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts."
Tony," Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country."
HOWARD STARK," Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?"
EDWIN JARVIS," You meet a lot of people, sir."
HOWARD STARK, Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
NEBULA, I'm you.
NEBULA, You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know how he does that? You wanna know what he does to you?
CLINT BARTON," Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. CLINT BARTON: Technically, he's not a raccoon, you know."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Whatever. He eats garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Who are you?
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Oh, good. You tell us where it is. Then we'll be on our way."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, The stone is down there.
CLINT BARTON, How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, No. I don't think so.
CLINT BARTON," Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.
CLINT BARTON, Yeah.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Whatever it takes.
CLINT BARTON, Whatever it takes.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead."
CLINT BARTON, Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I guess we do.
CLINT BARTON," I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.
CLINT BARTON," Oh, don't you get all decent on me now."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot."
CLINT BARTON," Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.
CLINT BARTON, Maybe you should.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You didn't.
CLINT BARTON," You're a pain in my ass, you know that?"
CLINT BARTON, Okay. You win.
CLINT BARTON, Tell my family I love them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You tell them yourself.
CLINT BARTON, Damn you!
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Let me go.
CLINT BARTON," No. Please, no."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, It's okay.
CLINT BARTON," Please– [Natasha kicks the wall, falls off the rope, and plummets to the ground.] NO!!!"
BRUCE BANNER, Did we get them all?
RHODEY, You telling me this'll actually work?
BRUCE BANNER," Clint, where's Nat?"
Tony, Do we know if she had family?
STEVE ROGERS, Yeah. Us.
THOR, (confused) What?
Tony, I just asked him a question–
THOR," Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together."
CLINT BARTON, We can't get her back.
THOR, Wha– what?
CLINT BARTON, It can't be undone. It can't.
THOR," I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And ""can't"" seems very definitive don't you think?"
CLINT BARTON," (to Thor) Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?"
THOR," No, that's my point–"
CLINT BARTON," It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!"
CLINT BARTON, It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
BRUCE BANNER, She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
STEVE ROGERS, We will.
ROCKET, Boom!
ROCKET," All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?"
THOR, I'll do it.
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me?
THOR, It's okay.
EVERYONE," (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–"
STEVE ROGERS," Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. THOR: I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?"
SCOTT LANG, We should at least discuss it.
THOR," No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty."
Tony, It's not about that–
THOR, (hushes everyone up) It's not that– Stop it! Just let me! (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.
Tony ," Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition."
THOR, What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
RHODEY, Cheez Whiz?
THOR, Lightning.
Tony, Yeah.
BRUCE," Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me."
BRUCE BANNER, You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.
STEVE ROGERS, How do we know you will?
BRUCE BANNER, We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...I was made for this.
Tony," Good to go, yeah?"
BRUCE BANNER, Let's do it.
Tony," You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years."
BRUCE BANNER, Got it.
Tony," F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?"
BRUCE BANNER, Everybody comes home.
THOR, Take it off! Take it off!
STEVE ROGERS," No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?"
Tony," Talk to me, Banner."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm okay. I'm okay.
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce!
Tony, Don't move him.
BRUCE ROGERS, [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work?
THOR, Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
CLINT BARTON, (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.
SCOTT LANG, Guys– I think it worked!
ROCKET, I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
RHODEY, Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]
BRUCE BANNER," Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!"
ROCKET, Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
BRUCE BANNER, Rhodey!
RHODEY," Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!"
SCOTT LANG, What?
RHODEY, We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
SCOTT LANG," Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?"
CLINT BARTON, Cap?
CLINT BARTON, [under his breath] Damn.
NEBULA, I tried to kill you. Several times.
NEBULA," But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters."
Tony," Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. [He has Cap's shield.] You lose this again, I'm keeping it."
STEVE ROGERS, What happened?
Tony, You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.
Tony, What's he been doing?
THOR, Absolutely nothing.
STEVE ROGERS, Where are the stones?
Tony, Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
STEVE ROGERS, So we keep it that way.
THOR," You know it's a trap, right?"
Tony, Yeah. And I don't much care.
THOR," Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time."
Tony, Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
STEVE ROGERS, Born out of blood.
RHODEY," See you on the other side, man."
SCOTT LANG, Hang on! I'm coming!
CLINT BARTON," Oh, hey– I know you."
NEBULA, Father.
CLINT BARTON, What?!
NEBULA, You don't have to do this.
NEBULA, You've seen what we become.
NEBULA, You can change.
Tony," Okay, Thor. Hit me."
Y," Boss, wake up!"
THOR, I knew it!
SAM WILSON," Hey, Cap, you read me?"
SAM WILSON," Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?"
SAM WILSON, On your left.
DOCTOR STRANGE, Is that everyone?
WONG," What, you wanted more?"
STEVE ROGERS, AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir] –assemble.
THOR," No, no, give me that. You have the little one. [best meme ever]"
PETER PARKER," Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, ""It's been five years. Come on, they need us."" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time– Tony: He did? Oh, God."
PETER PARKER, What are you doing?
PETER PARKER," Oh, this is nice."
PETER QUILL, Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora (2014)] I thought I lost you.
PETER QUILL, Ow.
PETER QUILL, You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.
NEBULA," The choices were him, or a tree."
CLINT BARTON," Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?"
STEVE ROGERS, Get those stones as far away as possible!
BRUCE BANNER, No! We need to get them back where they came from.
Tony, No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
SCOTT LANG, Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn't our only time machine.
STEVE ROGERS," Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?"
VALKYRIE, Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!
Tony," Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?"
SCOTT LANG, Maybe ten minutes.
STEVE ROGERS, Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE," We're on it, Cap."
Tony," Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it."
DOCTOR STRANGE," If I tell you what happens, it won't happen."
Tony, You better be right.
THE WASP, It's a mess back here.
SCOTT LANG, It's– it's dead.
THE WASP, What?
SCOTT LANG, It's dead. I have to hotwire it.
CORVUS GLAIVE, She's not responding.
CHALLA, Clint! Give it to me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, You took everything from me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, You will.
PETER PARKER, I got it!
PETER PARKER, Activate Instant Kill!
CORVUS GLAIVE," But sire, our troops!"
PEPPER POTTS," Uh, is anyone else seeing this?"
PETER PARKER," I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!"
STEVE," Hey, Queens, heads up."
PEPPER POTTS," Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie's Pegasus]"
PETER PARKER," Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!"
SAM, What the hell is this?
Tony," F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?"
ROCKET," Oh, yeah!"
STEVE ROGERS," Danvers, we need an assist here."
PETER PARKER, Hi. I'm– Peter Parker.
CAROL DANVERS," Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?"
PETER PARKER, [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, Don't worry.
OKOYE, She's got help.
 opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers," Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]"
Tony, And I– am– Iron Man.
PETER PARKER," Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it. [He kneels]"
PETER PARKER, I'm sorry– Tony–
PEPPER POTTS, Hey.
Tony," [quietly] Hey, Pep.."
PEPPER POTTS, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?
PEPPER POTTS, Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.
CLINT," You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda.] We did it."
WANDA MAXIMOFF, She knows– They both do.
HAPPY," How you doing, Squirt?"
MORGAN STARK, Good.
HAPPY, You good? Okay. You hungry?
MORGAN STARK, Mm. Hm.
HAPPY, What do you want?
MORGAN STARK, Cheeseburgers.
HAPPY, You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
MORGAN STARK, Okay.
VALKYRIE," So, when can we expect you back?"
THOR, Um– about that–
VALKYRIE, Thor. Your people need a king.
THOR," No, they already have one."
VALKYRIE, That's funny. You're being serious?
THOR," It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are."
VALKYRIE, You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.
THOR, I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.
VALKYRIE, What will you do?
THOR," I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though."
ROCKET," Move it or lose it, hairbag."
THOR," Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well– [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first? [Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination]"
QUILL," Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge."
THOR," I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course."
QUILL," See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge."
THOR, Quail– you– that– that's your own–
QUILL, Quail?
THOR, –insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.
QUILL, It's Quill.
THOR, That's what I said.
DRAX, You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
NEBULA, Sounds fair.
QUILL, It's not necessary.
THOR, It's not.
QUILL, Okay?
ROCKET," I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives."
MANTIS," [enthusiastically] Oooh, yes. Please, use knives."
DRAX," Yeah, knives."
GROOT, I am Groot.
QUILL, Not necessary...
THOR, There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.
QUILL," [glances at Thor] Me, right?"
THOR," Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course."
BRUCE BANNER," Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities."
STEVE ROGERS," Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches."
BRUCE BANNER," You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss her, man."
STEVE ROGERS," Me, too."
Sam Wilson," You know, if you want, I can come with you."
STEVE ROGERS," You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though."
STEVE ROGERS, Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.
BUCKY BARNES, How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.
BUCKY BARNES," Gonna miss you, Buddy."
STEVE ROGERS," It's gonna be okay, Buck."
Sam Wilson, How long is this gonna take?
BRUCE BANNER, For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.
BRUCE BANNER," Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay?"
STEVE ROGERS, You bet.
BRUCE BANNER," Going quantum. Three, two, one–"
BRUCE BANNER," And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–"
Sam Wilson, Where is he?
BRUCE BANNER, I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.
Sam Wilson," Well, get him back."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm trying.
Sam Wilson, Get him the hell back!
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, I said, I'm trying!"
BUCKY BARNES, Sam...
BUCKY BARNES, Go ahead.
Sam Wilson, Cap?
 STEVE ROGERS," Hi, Sam."
Sam Wilson," So did something go wrong, or did something go right?"
 STEVE ROGERS," Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get."
Sam Wilson, How'd that work out for you?
 STEVE ROGERS, It was beautiful.
Sam Wilson, I'm happy for you. Truly.
 STEVE ROGERS, Thank you.
Sam Wilson, Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.
 STEVE ROGERS," Oh, That reminds me. [brings out his shield.] Try it on."
 STEVE ROGERS, How does it feel?
Sam Wilson, Like it's someone else's.
 STEVE ROGERS, It isn't.
Sam Wilson, Thank you. I'll do my best.
 STEVE ROGERS, That's why it's yours. [shakes Sam's hand]
Sam Wilson, [seeing elderly Steve's wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her?
 STEVE ROGERS," [smiling] No. No, I don't think I will. [Last lines]"
