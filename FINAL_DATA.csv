iron man," I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!"
" We can talk, sir."," Oh, I see. So it's personal?"
iron man," Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."
iron man," Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?  Come on, it's okay, laugh."
" Sir, I have a question to ask."," Yes, please."
 Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?," That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?  You're kidding me with the hand up, right?"
iron man," Yes. It's very cool.  I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.  Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace."
iron man, What's going on?
iron man, What have we got?
" Jimmy, stay with Stark!", Yeah.
iron man," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!"
" Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn't in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.]", Whoa!
" This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working.", Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
 You are unbelievable.," Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?"
 Nobody roped me into anything!, I'm so sorry.
" But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored."," Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?"
 It's right here. Here you go., There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
" Yeah, it's okay."," Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.  Okay, you, too. "
 I don't blow on a man's dice.," Come on, honey bear."
 I don't blow on a man's dice. , There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
 That's what happens.," Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?"
 This is where I exit., All right.
" Tomorrow, don't be late."," Yeah, you can count on it."
 I'm serious!," I know, I know.  Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go."
  She's cute., She's all right?  Hi.
 Hi., Yeah. Okay--
 It's okay?, Go.
 You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?, Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
" And what do you say to your other nickname? ""The Merchant of Death""?", That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
" Brown, actually."," Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals."
 You rehearse that much?, Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
 I can see that., I'd like to show you first-hand.
 All I want is a serious answer.," Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."""
 That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.," My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero."
 And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.," Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey."
 You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?, I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
" I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?", Give me an exploded view.
 The compression in cylinder three appears to be low., Log that.
"  I'm gonna try again, right now.", Please don't turn down my music.
 I'll keep you posted.  You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now., How'd she take it?
 Like a champ., Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
 Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.," That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there."
" Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door."," I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?"
 Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no., Is it a good representation of his spring period?
" Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked--", So?
" --not ""spring"" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced.", I need it. Buy it. Store it.
 Okay. The MIT commencement speech...," Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down..."
" Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.", Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
 I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.," What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?"
" As a matter of fact, I do.", I don't like it when you have plans.
 I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday., It's your birthday?
 Yes., I knew that. Already?
 Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.," Well, get yourself something nice from me."
 I already did., And?
" Oh, it was very nice.", Yeah.
" Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark."," You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay."
iron man, You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
" You did, sir.  I had to cut across Mulholland.", I got you. I got you.
 What's wrong with you? , What?
 Three hours., I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
 For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here., Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!
iron man," What you reading, platypus?"
 Nothing.," Come on, sour patch."
 I'm not sour., Don't be mad.
" I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?", I said I was sorry.
 You don't need to apologize to me., I told you I was sorry.
 I'm your man.," Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he..."
" You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.", I respect you.
" I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed...  Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?"," Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me."
" No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now.", You can't have sashimi without sake.
 You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible., It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
iron man," Yes, two, please."
" That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!"," Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out..."
" No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.", Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
 No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!, General.
" Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.", Thanks.
iron man," Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.  For your consideration, the Jericho. "
iron man, I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace! 
  Tony.," Obie, what are you doing up?"
 I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?, It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
" Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?", Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
" Hey, Tony. "," I'm sorry, this is the ""fun-vee."" The ""hum-drum-vee"" is back there."
 Nice job., See you back at base.
 I wouldn't do that if I were you., What the hell did you do to me?
" What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see?  I have a souvenir. Take a look.  I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.", What is this?
" That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm?  That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.", I don't remember.
" No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.", Where are we?
" Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up.", Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
" Do you understand me? Do as I do.  He says, ""Welcome, Tony, the most famous mass murderer ""in the history of America.""  He is honored.  He wants you to build the missile.  The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.  This one.", I refuse. 
 He wants to know what you think., I think you got a lot of my weapons.
" He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials.  He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free."," No, he won't. "
"  I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony? Or are you going to do something about it?"," Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week."
" Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?","  If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.  How many languages do you speak?"
" A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.", Who are these people?
" They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings.  You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process."," Uh-huh.  Okay, we don't need this."
 What is that?," That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?"
iron man," Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this."
 Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?, What do I call you?
 My name is Yinsen., Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
" Nice to meet you, too.  Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.", That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
 But what could it generate?," If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second."
 That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes., Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
iron man,  This is our ticket out of here.
 What is it?, Flatten them out and look. 
 Good. Good roll. Good roll., You still haven't told me where you're from.
 I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place., Got a family?
" Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?", No.
 Open your mouth. , What does he want?
 He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho. , What do you want? A delivery date?  I need him. Good assistant.
" Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again."," 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right."
 Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!, Say something. Say something back to him.
 He's speaking Hungarian. I don't..., Then speak Hungarian.
 Okay. I know., What do you know?
iron man, How'd that work?
" Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.", That's what I do.
 Let me finish this., Initialize the power sequence.
 Okay., Now!
 Tell me. Tell me., Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
 Yes., Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
 I have it.," Press Control ""l""."
" ""I."""," ""I."" ""Enter."""
 Got it.," ""l"" and ""Enter."" Come over here and button me up."
 Okay. All right., Every other hex bolt.
 They're coming!," Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done."
 They're coming.," Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?"
" We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time.", Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!  Yinsen! Yinsen!
iron man, Yinsen!
 Watch out!  Stark.," Come on.  We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it."
" This was always the plan, Stark."," Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up."
" My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this.", Thank you for saving me.
 Don't waste it. Don't waste your life., My turn.  Not bad.
iron man, Hey!  Hey!
" Watch it, coming up here.", Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.  Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
 Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.," Yeah, vacation's over."
" Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.", No.
" No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.", No is a complete answer.
 The doctor has to look at you.," I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other..."
 That's enough of that., ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
 Call for a press conference?, Yeah.
 What on earth for?," Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first."
 Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.," No, I'm fine."
" Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?"," Well, come on."
 You get me one of those?, There's only one left. I need it.
" Well, let's get this started, uh..."," Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?  Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and... "
 Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to., Good to see you.
 Good to see you.," I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability."
 Mr. Stark!," Hey, Ben."
iron man," I had my eyes opened.  I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International  until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be."
 I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers. ," What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well. "
" Well, that..uh... That went well.", Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
 Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?," Uh, optimistically, 40 points."
 At minimum., Yep.
" Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer."," Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy."
 That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons., It's my name on the side of the building.
 And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos., Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
 Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?, I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
" Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.", It works.
" Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?", Maybe.
 Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.," That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?"
 Never mind who told me. Show me., It's Rhodey or Pepper.
 I want to see it.," Okay, Rhodey. "
 Okay. , Okay? It works.
" Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I."," I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had..."
" Tony. Tony, no more of this ""ready, fire, aim"" business. You understand me?", That was Dad's line.
" Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!",  Pepper. How big are your hands?
 What?, How big are your hands?
 I don't understand why...," Get down here. I need you.  Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them.  Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec."
" Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?"," It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump."
" Speed bump, what does that mean?", It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine. 
 What do you want me to do?, Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
" Oh, my God! "," I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out."
 Is it safe?," Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes ""beep."""
" What do you mean, ""Operation""?"," It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire."
 Okay., Okay? Great.
" You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this."," No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm..."
" Okay, okay.", I really need your help here.
" Okay.  Oh, there's pus!"," It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body."
 It smells!," Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?"
" Okay, I got it! I got it!"," Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch  the sides when you're coming out!"
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.," That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't...  There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out."
" Oh, God!"," Okay, I was not expecting..."
" Okay, what do I do?", Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
 What's wrong?," Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--"
 What? You said it was safe!, 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
 Okay. Okay. Tony?, What?
 It's going to be okay. Okay?, Is it?
 It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.," Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you...  Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice."
 Are you okay?," Yeah, I feel great. You okay?"
" Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.", I don't have anyone but you. Anyway... 
 What do you want me to do with this? , That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
 You don't want to keep it?," Pepper, I've been called many things. ""Nostalgic"" is not one of them."
" Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"," That will be all, Miss Potts.  Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff."
" The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.", Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
" Hello, sir."," Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with."
 Don't do that!, What was his name?
 Don't do that., Was it Ivan?
 Don't do that. They'll believe it., Okay.
 Don't do that., Okay.
 Don't do that., Pleasure meeting you.
" Give us a couple minutes, you guys.  I'm surprised.", Why?
" I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.", I'm doing a little better than walking.
 Really?," Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it."
" You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.", This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
 What? You're a humanitarian now or something?, I need you to listen to me.
 No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious., Okay.
" It's nice seeing you, Tony. ", Thanks.
iron man," JARVIS, you up?"
" For you, sir, always."," I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two."
 Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?," Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?"
" Working on a secret project, are we, sir?"," I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."
iron man," Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy."
iron man," Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one."
iron man," Up two. All right, set that."
 I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?," Yeah, everything's... What? "
 Obadiah's upstairs., Great!
 What would you like me to tell him?, Great. I'll be right up.
 Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.," It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.  I didn't expect that.  How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?"
 Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad. ," Sure doesn't. Oh, boy."
 It would have gone better if you were there.," Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all..."
" Hey, come on. In public. The press.  This was a board of directors meeting.", This was a board of directors meeting?
 The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction., A what?
 They want to lock you out.," Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen."
 Fifty-six and a half., It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
" Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest."," I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great. "
" Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.", I'll be in the shop.
" Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs."," No. No, absolutely not."
 It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!," This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it."
" All right, well, this stays with me, then.  Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.", Thank you.
 You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?," Good night, Obie. "
iron man,"  Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one.  Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one.  Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay.  No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly."
iron man," JARVIS, are you there?"
" At your service, sir.", Engage heads-up display.
 Check., Import all preferences from home interface.
" Will do, sir."," All right, what do you say?"
" I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.", Can we start the virtual walk-around?
 Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment., Do a check on control surfaces
 As you wish.  Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.," Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control."
" Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is..."," JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one.  Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?"
" The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.", Records are made to be broken! Come on! 
" Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring."," Keep going! Higher!  We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!"
iron man, Kill power.
iron man, Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
" A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.", Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
 Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?, Thrill me.
" Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society."," JARVIS, we get an invite for that?"
 The render is complete.," A little ostentatious, don't you think?"
 What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet., Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
" Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete."," Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it."
 Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.," Don't wait up for me, honey."
" Hey, Tony, remember me?"," Sure don't. You look great, Hef."
 We're going to have a great quarter., What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
" Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.", I'll see you inside.
" Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them", You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
 Mr. Stark?, Yeah?
 Agent Coulson.," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the.."
" Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division."," God, you need a new name for that."
" Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things.", Let's just put something on the books.
 How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?," Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you."
 What are you doing here?, Just avoiding government agents.
 Are you by yourself?, Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
" Oh, it was a birthday present.", That's great.
" From you, actually."," Well, I got great taste."
 Yes., You want to dance?
" Oh, no."," All right, come on."
 Thank you. No., Am I making you uncomfortable?
 No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back., You look great and you smell great.
" Oh, God.", But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
 I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me., I'd make it a week. Sure.
 Really? What's your Social Security number?, Five.
 Five?, Right.
 Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.," The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?"
" Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.", Totally harmless.
" It was totally not harmless, by the way.", We're dancing. No one's even watching.
" Everybody who I work with... No, you know why?", I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
" No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you.", I don't think it was taken that way.
 Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to..., I just think you're overstating it.
" You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please."," Got it, okay."
" I would like a vodka martini, please.", Okay.
" Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives."," Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?"
 Wow. Tony.," Oh, hey."
 Fancy seeing you here., Carrie.
 Christine., Carrie.
 Christine., That's right.
 You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?, Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
 'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity, Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
" I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker."," I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear."
 Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?, When were these taken?
 Yesterday., I didn't approve any shipment.
" Well, your company did."," Well, I'm not my company."
" Please, do you mind?", Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
" Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive."," You know what? I was naive before, when they said, ""Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business."" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?"
" The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, ""Where are my mother and father?"" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.", He's all yours.
" Sergeant, clear a hole.", Hello?
 Tony?, Who's this?
 It's Rhodes.," Sorry, hello?"
 I said it's Rhodes.," Speak up, please."
 What in the hell is that noise?," Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down."
" Yeah, well, I need your help right now."," It's funny how that works, huh?"
" Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive."," Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?"
" Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?"," I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon."
 I thought you were driving.," Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog."
 You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?, Nope!
" Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.", That's my exit.
 Then you are clear to engage., Hit it.
 Inbound missile., Flares!
iron man, Deploy flaps!
 Hello?," Hi, Rhodey, it's me."
 It's who?," I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me."
" No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?", This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
" Tony, you still there?"," Hey, thanks."
" Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?"," Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?"
" No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?", Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
" It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.", Hey!
" It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt."," Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to..."
 What's going on here?, Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
"  Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor, and I'm going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers. I want a prototype right away."," Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading."
 And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?," Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them."
" Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.", There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
" Is that so? Well, then, I quit. "," You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?"
" You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it."," I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."
"  I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.",  Good boy.
 Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?, Where's Pepper?
 She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah., That's not going to be enough.
 That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.," Not bad, huh? Let's do it."
 You need me to do anything else?, Keep the skies clear.
 I thought it'd be bigger., How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
" The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.", Keep me posted. Pepper!
" Tony! Tony, are you okay?", I'm fine. How are...
" Obadiah, he's gone insane!"," I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there."
 He built a suit., Get out of there right now!
 Where do you think you're going? Your services are no longer required., Stane!
 I love this suit!, Put them down!
" Collateral damage, Tony.", Divert power to chest RT.
 Power reduced to 19%.," Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
" Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.", Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
" With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--", I know the math! Do it!
" Thirteen percent power, sir.", Climb!
 Eleven percent., Keep going!
 Seven percent power., Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!
" You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!", How'd you solve the icing problem?
 Icing problem?, Might want to look into it.
 Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power., Woah! Potts!
" Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?", I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
 Nice try!, Weapons status?
 Repulsors offline. Missiles offline., Flares!
" Very clever, Tony.", Potts?
 Tony!, This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
" Well, how are you going to do that?"," You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here."
 Okay. I'm going in now., Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important! 
" How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!", Pepper!
 And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!, Time to hit the button!
" Hold still, you little prick!", Just do it!
 You'll die!, Push it!
"  You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony's personal security staff..."," ""Iron Man."" That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway."
 Here's your alibi., Okay?
 You were on your yacht., Yeah.
" We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests."," See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island."
 That's what happened., All right.
" Just read it, word for word.", There's nothing about Stane here.
 That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.," But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?"
 Right. Let's get this show on the road.," You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man."
 You're not Iron Man., Am so.
 You're not.," All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night."
 What night?, You know.
" Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?"," Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts."
" And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.", Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
" I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you..."," I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero."
 I never said you were a superhero.," Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public."
" Just stick to the cards, man."," Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man."
iron man, Jarvis!
" ""I am Iron Man."" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.", Who the hell are you?
"  Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.",  Ah.
 I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative., Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…
iron man, Yes
 Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!, It’s good to be back. You missed me?
 Blow something up!," I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day."
 I love you Tony!," Please, it’s not about me.  It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.  And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard."
 Make sure you join me…," All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out."
" Open up, let’s go."," Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you."
" Tony, Tony"," Hey, hey."
" Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",  Hello. It would be a pleasure.
 Okay.,  See you buddy.
 This is Larry.," Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you."
 Larry King.," Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people."
"  Come on, Tony. There we go.", Very mellow.
 That wasn’t so bad.," No, it was perfect."
" Look what we got here, the new model."," Hey, does she come with the car?"
 I certainly hope so. Hi., Hi. And you are?
 Marshal., Irish. I like it.
 Pleased to meet you Tony., I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
 Bedford., What are you doing here?
 Looking for you., Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
 Serving subpoenas. , Yikes.
  He doesn’t like to be handed things.," Yeah, I have a peeve."
 I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am., Can I see a badge?
  You still like it?, Yep.  How far are we from D.C.?
" Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.",  Yes dear?
 Can I have your attention?, Absolutely.
 Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?, I do not.
 You do not?," I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon."
 The Iron Man weapon., My device does not fit that description.
 Well… How would you describe it?," I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator."
 As?, It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
" It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark."," Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…"
 My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.," Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it."
" Look, I’m no expert…", In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
" I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor."," Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance."
 That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber., Rhodey? What?
iron man," Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here."
" Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.", I just…
 Drop it.," All right, I’ll drop it."
" …into the existing chain of command, Senator."," I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice."
iron man, We can amend the hours a little bit.
" … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational."," Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on."
 What is he doing?," If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. "
 Can you turn that off? Take it off. , Iran.
iron man, No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
iron man," Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up."
" Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.","  Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty."
 I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…," The point is, you’re welcome, I guess"
 For what?, Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
iron man, I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
iron man, What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
"  you, Mr Stark.  you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.",  Okay.
 You’ve been a delight.," Wake up, Daddy’s home."
iron man, You!
iron man, I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
iron man, How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
" We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.", Check palladium levels.
" Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.","  God, they’re running out quick."
 Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…, Mute.
 Is this a joke? What are you thinking?, What?
 What are you thinking?," Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick."
 Did you just donate…, Keep your business.
 …our entire modern art collection to the…, Boy Scouts of America.
 …Boy Scouts of America?," Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence."
" No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.", It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
" You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.","  Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part."
 The Expo is a gigantic waste of time., I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
 That’s rude., There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
 The Expo is your ego gone crazy.,  Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
 You’ve got to be kidding., I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
 Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?, No. Our stocks have never been higher.
" Yes, from a managerial standpoint."," You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back."
 Let me give you an example., Let’s move onto another subject.
" No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.", I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
iron man, Let’s see what I can get going on here.
" Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.", Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
" And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…", Everything was my idea.
 …and you won’t make a decision., I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert.  You do it.
 I do what?, Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
" Yeah, I’m trying to run the company."," Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it."
 You will not give me the information…, I’m not asking you to try…
 …in order to…, I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
 I am trying to do it.," Pepper, you’re not listening to me!"
" No, you are not listening to me.", I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
 Have you been drinking?," Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.  Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. . I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you.  Congratulations? Take it, just take it."
 I don’t know what to think.," Don’t think, drink. There you go. "
 The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?, I’m on happy time.  Sorry.
 What the hell was that?, It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
" It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it"," All right, put them up. Come on. "
  Lesson one. Never take your eye off… ," That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?"
 Rushman. Natalie Rushman , Front and centre. Come into the church.
 No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…," If it pleases the court, which it does."
  I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric., Can you give her a lesson?
 No problem.,  Pepper.
 What?,  Who is she?
 She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.," I need a new assistant, boss."
" Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.", I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
" What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? "," How do I spell your name, Natalie?"
" What, are you gonna google her now?"," I thought I was ogling her.  Wow. Very, very impressive individual."
" You’re so predictable, you know that?"," She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?"
 No one speaks Latin., No one speaks Latin
" It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.", Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
 Well…, I need her. She’s got everything that I need. 
" Oh, my God! Happy.", That’s what I’m talking about.
 I just slipped., You did?
  Yeah., Looks like a TKO to me. 
 Just… I need your impression.," You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul."
 I meant your fingerprint., Right.
" So, how are we doing?", Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
" Will that be all, Mr Stark?", No.
" Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. ", I want one.
 No.," You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it."
 Mr Stark?, Hey.
 Hello. How was your flight?," It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you."
 When did this happen?, What? You made me do it.
 I made you do what?," You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils."
 You are so predictable., That’s the amazing thing.
 Right this way., You look fantastic.
" Why, thank you very much.", But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
 You have a 9:30 dinner., Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
 Absolutely., Is this us?
 It can be., Great. Make it us.
 Thank you very much.," Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic."
" Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.", You do?
 Yeah., Then we’ll make it work.  You want a massage?
" Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.", I’ll have Natalie make an…
 I don’t want Natalie to do…," Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you."
 Thank you very much., Green is not your best colour. 
 Anthony. Is that you?,  My least favourite person on Earth.
" Hey, pal.", Justin Hammer.
 Yes.," Yes, roughly."
" Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.", And she wrote a story as well.
 It was very impressive., That was good.
 I’m gonna go wash., Don’t leave me.
" Hey, buddy. How you doing?", I’m all right.
 Looking gorgeous.," Please, this is tough."
 …that you guys have seen each other?," God, that’s so awful."
" Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?", Since he got his contract revoked…
" Actually, it’s on hold.", …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
" No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo."," Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot."
 Mr Stark?, Yes?
" I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do."," Hammer needs a slot, Christine."
" We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders.",  Got any other bad ideas?
 …is a healthy…, …and owning a race car…
 …competition., …if you don’t drive it?
 Car!, Are you okay?
 Yeah., Were you heading from me or him?
 I was trying to scare him., ‘Cause I can’t tell!
 Are you out of your mind?, Better security.
 Get in the car right now!, I was attacked. We need better security.
 Get in the car.," You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing.  First vacation in two years. "
 I got him!, Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
 Take the case! Take it!, Give him the case!
 Stop banging the car! , Calm down.
 God. God., Give me the case! Please! Come on! 
] Five minutes.)," Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places."
" You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed."," Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?"
 My father. Anton Vanko.," Well, I never heard of him."
 My father is the reason you’re alive.," The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed."
" Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.", Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. 
" It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”", Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
 What is that?, This is your in-flight meal.
 Did you just make that?, Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
" Tony, what are you not telling me?"," I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?"
" Oh, yes.", It’s a great place to be healthy.
 I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.," Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…"
" Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up."," As CEO, you are entitled to a leave."
 A leave?, A company retreat.
 A retreat? During a time like this?," Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out."
" Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?", Let’s go. 
" Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?"," Yeah, I should get to my desk.  See that cigar box?"
 Yeah., It’s palladium.
  Is that supposed to be smoking?," If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall."
 You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?, Road rash. Thank you.  What are you looking at?
 I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.," You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing."
" Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?", I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
 Probably., Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
 Ill-timed.," Right, sends the wrong message."
 Inappropriate.  Is that dirty enough for you?," Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over.  I’ll take that. Why don’t you…  I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?"
 Legal.," Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?"
 Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.,"  You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that. "
 Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?, I love you.
" Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming."," No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles."
" You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?", You’re out of control gorgeous.
 It’s time to go to bed. It’s time., Give me another smooch
 You’re not going to be happy about this.," Come on, you know you want to."
 You just peed in the suit., I know. It has a filtration system.
 It’s not sexy., You could drink that water.
" Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…", If you say so.
" Okay. I’ll take this, you take that "," Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door.  Yeah!  Hit!  Pull!  I think she wants the Gallagher!"
  I’m only gonna say this once. Get out.  You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!,  Goldstein.
" Yes, Mr Stark?", Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. 
  I told you to shut it down. ," Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.  Really?  Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick."
 Pepper!  Get out of here. Get out of here now. , You want it? Take it! 
 Put you hand down., You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
" We don’t have to do this, Tony."," You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot."
 Put it down!, You gonna take a shot?
 Put it down!, No!
 Drop it Tony!, Take it! 
 Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.,  I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
" No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?", It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
 I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet., Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
 That’s not looking so good., I’ve been worse. 
 We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.,  You’re fired.
" Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.", Hi.
" I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.", I suggest you apologise.
" You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…", You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
" Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.", What do you want from me?
" What do we want from you? What do you want from me?  You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.  Hit him."," Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?"
 What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work., Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
 Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.," Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element."
 That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.," No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…"
" No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery."," Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?"
" Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.", You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
 He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started., He said that?
" Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart."," I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan."
 What do you remember about your dad?," He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school."
 That’s not true.," Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did."
" As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.", What?
 I got a two o’clock," Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?"
" Okay, you’re good, right?"," No, I’m not good."
 You got this? Right? Right?, Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
" Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?", Yeah.
" And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. ","  Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice."
" I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?"," I think I got it, yeah."
 $6. Six., I don’t have any dough. Here. 
" No, sir, that’s too much."," No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine"
" No, señor."," Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great."
 Are you Iron Man?, Sometimes.
 Miss Potts?, Relax.
 Mr Stark…, Is here.
 He refuses…, I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
 Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…, Mute.
" No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.",  I’ll get this stuff out of here.
" Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo.  Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony be there?",  Will I?
" No, he will not. Bye.", I would like to be. Got a minute?
 No.," Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds."
 Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.," I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not."
 You didn’t come here to apologise?," Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…"
 No.," Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it."
" Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?", Yes.
" People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?", Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
 I need you…, I need you too.
 …to leave now, That’s what I’m trying to…
" Anything else, boss?"," I’m good, Hap."
" No, I’ll be just another minute."," I lost both the kids in the divorce.  Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?"
 No. That’s not so., It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
 Absolutely.  I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.," Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?"
 , Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
 It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. , You’re good. Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
iron man," Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection."
" 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.",  How many buildings are there?
 Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?, That was rhetorical. Just show me.  What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
" What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?"," I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.  Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad.  Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. "
 The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium., Thank Dad.
" Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise."," Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode."
 I heard you broke the perimeter.," Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?"
 I was doing some stuff.," Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?"
  What’s this doing here?, That’s it. Bring that to me.
 You know what this is?,"  It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it.  Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?"
 Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico., Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
 So I’m told., Secret stuff?
 Something like that. Good luck., Bye. Thanks. 
 We need you.," Yeah, more than you know."
 Initialising prismatic accelerator.  Approaching maximum power. , That was easy. 
" I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. "," Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…"
 Incoming call with a blocked number sir., My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
" Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.", You what?
 You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice., You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
 You too.,  Trace him.
" Now, the true history of Stark name will be written."," Jarvis, where is he?"
" What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.", Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
 Sir," You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now."
 We are unclear as to the effects.," I don’t want to hear it Jarvis.  That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!"
" For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… ", We got trouble.
" Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.", Give them a wave.
" Hey, all right. Yeah.", All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
" Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?"," Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko."
 Yeah. , What is he?
 What?, Where’s Vanko?
 Who?, Tell me.
" Whoa, whoa, whoa.",  Is that you?
" No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up!  Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.",  Let’s take it outside. 
" No, no!"," Jarvis, break in. I need to own him."
" Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.", On what?
 Okay. Right away. Right away.  Step aside. Step aside.  Tell me everything you know. Go., How are we doing Jarvis?
" No, I’m driving. Get in the car.", Nice work kid. 
 You got multiples coming in on you., Let’s get this away from the Expo.
" Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.", Got it.
 I got him! Sees what Natasha has done," Rhodey, you still locked on?"
 Yeah., Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
 He’s gone., I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
 Reboot complete  You got your best friend back.," Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff."
 Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.," Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you."
  What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?," Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. "
 What’s going on?, I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
 You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?, You didn’t let me.
 Why didn’t you tell me that?, I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
" Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.", Great. Pepper?
 Are you okay now?, I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
 I am mad!, …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
 Fine., We could have been in Venice.
 Oh please.," Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up."
"  Oh, man. You can have your suit back.",  You okay?
" Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?", Don’t be.
 No. I should have trusted you more., I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
 No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.," Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?"
" Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.", Got you. Where do you want to be?
 Where are you going?, What’re you talking about?
 I meant me., You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
" Tony, don’t be jealous.", No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
 Yeah. It’s called being a badass., Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
 Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.," Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?"
" It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. ", See that?
" Yeah, yeah. Nice.", Rhodey? Get down. 
 Wow. I think you should lead with that next time., Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
 This ain’t gonna be good.  I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife., With the what?  Hammer tech?
 Yeah., I got this.  Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
 What?, I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
 This is your idea?, Yep.
" I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!", Take it! 
 All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man., Pepper? 
 Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore., You can’t?
 I can’t take this., Look at me.
" My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.", I think I did okay. 
 I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.," What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses."
 I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses., You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
" No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified."," Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better."
 Well…," You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?"
 Thank you., Yeah.
 Thank you for understanding.," Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up."
 I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth., Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
" Well, with you it’s like dog years.", I know.
" I mean, it’s like the Presidency. ", Weird.
" No, it’s not weird."," It’s okay, right?"
 Yeah., Run that by me again. 
" I had just quit, actually."," Yeah, so we’re not…"
 You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing., You should get lost.
 I was here first. Get a roof., I thought you were out of one-liners.
 That’s the last one.," You kicked ass back there, by the way."
" Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?", Not okay. Not okay with that.
 It wasn’t a question. , How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
" I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. "," “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it."
 Read on., “Tony not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. 
 Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. ,"  You can’t afford me.  Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter."
 (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.," Hey, do you want...?"
" I got you, pal.", I gave a speech? How was it?
 Unintelligible., Really?
 Mmm-hmm.," It's my favorite kind, a winning combo."
 Where are we going?," Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research."
 Mr. Stark," Oh, I finally met a man called ""Ho."""
" I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.","  Oh, this guy."
 Mr. Stark.," Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)"
 My work?, Who isn't? He means me.
" Yeah, we're full."," Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut."
" Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately-funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. ", Uh... she'll take both.
 Okay. , One to throw away and one to not call.
" Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?"," I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt."
 Aw!," (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first."
" (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you.", I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
 Yeah?," Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.  I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?"
 I'll see you up there., Damn betcha.
iron man, Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
" Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...", Wow.
 ...And chemically recode it., That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
 ...Genetic operating system..., ...of a...
 Exactly., ...living organism.
 Yes., Wow.
 Can you not touch my plant? It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers..., She's not like the others.​​​​​​ (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
" That's cute, but...", Leave her ficus alone.
"  Because... and, no, seriously don't. ", And you're starting with plants?
" For now, yeah.", Huh.
 Dendritic revitalization., It's revolutionary.
 Disease prevention..., Changes the world.
 ...even limb regrowth., You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
 Wow., In Switzerland.
" Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.", This week.
iron man," You almost bought it, didn't you?"
" This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.", Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
" Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.", We're good.
 Stay down., You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?
 It's a glitch in my work. It's..., She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
 No., Hey!
 Happy New Year., Happy New Year.
 Happy New Year.," Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight."
 You good?, Yep.
 I'll be right outside., Okay.
iron man,"  So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it."
iron man,"  Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am."
iron man, Ow!
" Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...", No. Forty-eight.  Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
" As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore."," Which I will. Right, let's do this."
iron man," Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it."
iron man," Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it."
" Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours."," Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother."
iron man," Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence."
iron man," Jarvis, drop my needle."
iron man, Crap.
iron man," Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all."
iron man," Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a..."
iron man, ...little bit.
iron man," Cool it, will you, Jarvis?"
iron man, Come on. I ain't scared of you.
iron man, I'm the best.
" As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.",  And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
iron man,  That's when he happened.
" It tested well with focus groups, alright?",  I am Iron Patriot...
" Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message."," So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?"
" It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.", Nine.
" The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings."," You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air."
 When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?, Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
" People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.", You're gonna come at me like that?
 Do you mind signing my drawing?," If Richard doesn't mind.  You alright with this, Dick?"
 Fine with me.,  What's your name?
 Erin.," I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way."
" Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not..."," It's not superhero business, I get it."
" No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.", That's why I said I...got it.
 Are you okay?, I broke the crayon.
 Wait a minute! Tony!, What'd he say?!
 Tony!, Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
iron man," Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?"
 No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.," Okay, so I was poisoned?"
 My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack., Me?
" Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up."," Sorry, I gotta split."
 Hello?, Is this forehead of Security?

" I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.", What's going on? Fill me in.
 For real?, Yeah.
" Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.", Right.
" I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces."," Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best."
" Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?", Um...Switzerland.
" Right, right, exactly."," Killian? No, I don't remember that guy."
" Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.", His what?
" Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? ", Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
" I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here."," Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing."
" Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.", Relax.
 Seriously?, I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
" You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.", A giant brain?
" Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it."," I miss you, Happy."
" Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird..."," Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?"
 Why?," I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her."
" You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?", Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
" Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?"," Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so."
iron man," Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?"
" Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?"," Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall."
 Okay.," So, uh...tense? Good day?"
iron man," Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?"
 Did I like it?," Nailed it, right?"
 So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?," Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the..."
 Uh-huh., The facial slit?
" Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?", Crowbar. Yeah.
iron man," Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak."
 I'll take my chances., That's risky.
iron man, At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
iron man, Busted.
 This is a new level of lame., Sorry.
" You ate without me, already? On date night?",  He was just...
 You mean you?," Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work."
 Uh-huh.," And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian."
 What?, What?
 Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?, Happy was concerned.
" No, you're spying on me.", I wasn't...
 I'm going to bed., Hold on. Come on. Pep.
iron man," Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry."
iron man," I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything."
iron man, Nothing's been the same since New York.
" Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all."," You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker."
iron man," But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh..."
 Machines., They're part of me.
 A distraction., Maybe.
 I'm gonna take a shower., Okay.
 And you're gonna join me., Better.
 Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony..., Power down!

 Sure. ," Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant.  One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. "
" Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. "," Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided  that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked.  That's what you wanted, right?  Bill me. "
" I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. "," Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning ""adviser to the King"". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater.  Close. "
 The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly., No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
" No, sir."," Talk to me, Happy.  When is a bomb not a bomb?  When is a bomb not a bomb?  Any military victims?"
" Not according to public records, sir."," Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees."
 The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now., Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.  Nope.  That. You sure that's not one of his?
 It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide., Bring her around.
 The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. ," That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?"

" There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. "," Right there's fine.  You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?"
 You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?," Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast."
" Gluten-free waffles, sir.", That's right.
" Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent."," Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.  It's...with her."
" Tony, is somebody there? "," Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.  Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.  Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met."
" He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.", What...what for? Why now?
" Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.", I'll be fine.
" I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.", We weren't.
 And old girlfriends!, She's not really.
" No, not really. It...it was just one night.", Yep.
" That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.", It was a great night.
 I'm sure., What?
 Trust me.  We're going out of town.," Okay, we've been through this. Nope."
 Yep!, The man says no.
 Immediately and indefinitely!, Honey...
 Great idea. Let's go., I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
" Tony, this is how normal people behave.", I can't protect you out there. I challenged... 
 Is...is that normal?," Yes, this is normal!"
" Sadly, that...is very normal."," It's a big bunny, relax about it!"
 Calm down!, I got this for you.
 I'm aware of that., You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
 I don't like it!, I asked you three... You don't like it?! 
" Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.", I said no.
" Guys, can we um...", What?
 I got you.," I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.  Move! I'm right behind!  Get her, I'm gonna find a way around.  Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! "

" Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. ", That's one.
" Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. ", That's two.

 That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. ," It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?"
" We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee."," Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta..."
 I prepared a flight plan. This was the location., Who asked you? Open the suit.
" I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.", Open eject.  That's brisk!  Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
" I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. "," Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. "

 Freeze! Don't move.," You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.  And now you're out of ammo."

 What does it power?  Oh my God!  Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?," Technically, I am."
" Technically, you're dead. ", A valid point.
  What happened to him?," Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him."
 Like a mechanic?, Yeah.
 Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.,  It's Iron Patriot now.
 That's way cooler!," No, it's not."
" Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...", Retroreflective panels?
 To make him stealth mode., You want a stealth mode?
" Cool, right?", That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
  Oops!," Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone."
 S...Sorry.," Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?"
" Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago."," Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich."
 What's in it for me?, Salvation. What's his name?
 Who?," The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?"
 How'd you know that?," I got just the thing.  This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.  Deal? Deal? What'd you say?"
 Deal., Deal?  What's you're name?
 Harley. And you're..., The mechanic. Tony  You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich?

 Well then. What are we waiting for?," The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. "
" She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?"," Maybe never, relax about it."
" What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?"," I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space.  What's the official story here? What happened?"
" I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. "," Six people died, right?"
 Yeah., Including Chad Davis?
 Yeah. ," Yeah. That doesn't make sense.  Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows."
" Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.", Do you buy that?
 That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?, No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
" That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?", That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
 Are they coming back? The aliens?," Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?"
 Does this subject make you...make you edgy?," Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?"
 Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?, Nope.
 Do you need to be on it?, Probably.
 Do you have PTSD?, I don't think so.
" Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?"," Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out!  Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?"
" What did I say?  Hey, wait up! Wait, wait.  What the hell was that? "," Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?"
 Where she always is.," See, now you're being helpful.  Sorry.  Lady, this uh... "
 Thank you. ," Nice haircut, suits you."

 Free country., It sure is. 
 Alright. Where'd you like to start?, I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
" Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go.  Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. "," Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?"
 Yeah. ," Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him."
 What?, As a weapon.
" Deputy, get this woman and... "," Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go.  Crazy, huh?"
 Yeah.," Watch this.   You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. "
 That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?," Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.  "
" Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, ""I want my god damn file."""," It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies.  Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. "
 You're welcome, For what? Did I miss something?
 Me saving your life," Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose."
" Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected."," What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up.

" So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?"," Yep  Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?"

 Sort of.," That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?"
" It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right.

" Actually, sir, it's in Miami."," Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is."

" But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.", You're something else.
" You have met him, I assume?", Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
" I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.", What's next for you in your world?
" The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.", You are a maniac.
" You're not going deaf, are you?","  Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?"
iron man, Very nice.
iron man," Break it, you bought it."
iron man," Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first."
iron man, You'll see.
" It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters."," Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two..."
iron man," All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!"
iron man, You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
iron man," Here it comes. Three, four..."
iron man,"  Five, four, three, two, one!  Told you. Where's the rest?  Where's the rest?  "
" Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. "," Ah! Better late than never.  Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way."
"  All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound."," Ah! Let's go!  Aw, crap."
 Tony?," Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit."
 No. You got yours'?," Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet."
" You, you, you! Move! Get out!",  The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
 What's this? I had winners. , What have you come as?
" You make a move, and I break your face.",I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
 This is the Mandarin?,"Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing."
" Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.","Here's how it works, Meryl Streep."
" Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.", Spill.
 Do you know what they did to my suit?, What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
" Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off."," Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?"
" Yeah, a little bit.", So?
" What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport."," Right.  Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is."
" But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?", Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
 Thanks. Hello?," Sir, this is Tony."
 Welcome back to the land of the living., We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
" Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.", And what about the suit I'm wearing?
 The armour is now at 92%., That's going to have to do.
 Let us out! , The President. Now.
" He's not here.  Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. "," Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.  How many in the air?"
" Thirteen, sir.", How many can I carry?
" Four, sir."," Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?"
"  Oh, God! No! No!"," Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?"
 What? Oh!," I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do."
" 18,000 feet."," Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice."
" 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet."," Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!"
" 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir."," He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. "
 We made it!," Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...  That came out of nowhere. Wow "
" Give me some good news, man.", I think they all made it.
" Oh, thank God."," Yeah, but I missed the president."
" You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?"," Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?"
" The House Party Protocol, sir?", Correct.
"  Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?", I hope not.
" Oh, my God.  He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.", Viking funeral. Public execution.
 ls your gun up?, Yep. What do I do?
" Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back."," Six, high, back. Alright.  You see that? Nailed it."
" Yeah, you really killed the glass.", You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. 
"  I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.", I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
" They're not universal, Tony."," I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one."
 Okay, Give me one of yours.
 I don't have one that fits that gun.," You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?"
 What'd you see?," Too fast. Nothing. Here we go.  Three guys, one girl, all armed."
" God, I would kill for some armour right now.", You're right. We need backup.
" Yeah, a bunch.", You know what? 
 Is that...?, Yep.
 Are those...?," Yeah.  Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice."
"  Yes, sir.", What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
 Gentlemen. ," Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. "
" This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?"," Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?  Nice timing."
" Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?"," Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me."
 What does that mean?, I got you covered.
" Sir, I've located Ms Potts.", About time.
  Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down., See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
 You're such a jerk.," Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.  Come on. A little more, baby. "
 She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. ," Yeah, you take a minute.  Jarvis, give me a suit right now!  Oh, come on!"
" Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on.  Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.", Nice work.
" What do you mean ""ready""? "," Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! "
 A shame. I would've caught her. , Eject. 
" Mark 42, inbound.", I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.  Whatever.
" You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect."," Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.  Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42."
"  No!  No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. *I AM THE MANDARIN!!!* "," I got nothing.  Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?  Honey?"
" Oh, my God. That was really violent.", You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
 I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?, It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
" You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?"," Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here."
" No, don't touch me.", Don't worry about it.
" No, I'm gonna burn you."," No, you're not. Not hot."
 Am I gonna be okay?," No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff."
 And all your distractions?, Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
" All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?", You know what to do.
" The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?"," Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.  Okay, so far? Do you like it?"
"  No, look."," To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.  And the fact that you've been able to -help me process...  Are you with me?"
" Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...", Are you actively napping?
  I was... I... I drifted., Where did I lose you?
 Elevator in Switzerland.," So, you heard none of it?"
 I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training., So?
 I don't have the..., What? The time?
 Temperament.," You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?"
 Yes.," I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird."
  Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack. ,  Shit!
  Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.," Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?"""
" Sir, the city is taking fire."," Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion."
"  Stark, we really need to get inside."," I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?"
 There's a particle wave below the north tower.," Great, I wanna poke it with something.  Drawbridge is down, people."
 Find the scepter. ," And for gosh sake, watch your language!"
  That's not going away anytime soon.," Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.  It was a good talk."
 No it wasn't.," Sentry mode.  Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ."
" Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby."," I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick."
 The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement... and an air current.,"  Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...  Yay! "
" Guys, I got Strucker."," Yeah, I got... something bigger.  Thor, I got eyes on the prize."
" The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.  Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout."," Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?"
" Uh, yeah, she knows her way around."," Thanks.  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment."
 Very good sir.," JARVIS, take the wheel."
" Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.","  It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but..."
 As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?," Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?  I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?"
" Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.", Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
" Lab's all set up, boss.","  Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler."
  How's he doing?," Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton."
 That's terrible.," He's fine. He's thirsty.  Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis."
 The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify., So there's elements you can.
 The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful., Like a reactor?
" If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes."," Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?"
" No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.",  Here's your beverage.
" That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust."," Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday."
 What's the rumpus?," Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize, "
 Doctor.," Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."
 Oh?, Top of the line.
 I suspect not for long., Meet the competition. 
 It's beautiful.," If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?"
" Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a... it's not a human mind, it...", Um-um.
" I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing."," Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door."
 Artificial intelligence.," This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron."
 I thought Ultron was a fantasy.," Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol."
 That's a mad-sized if.," Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA."
" Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA."," As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?"
 The only people threatening the planet would be people?," I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days."
 So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.," Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world."
" Sounds like a cold world, Tony."," I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.  What did we miss?"
" I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments."," Thanks, buddy."
" Enjoy yourself, sir.", I always do. 
 I don't get it. The mission. G-give me a second. , Peace in our time.
" Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?", No.
" Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?"," Well, Miss Potts has a company to run."
" Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.", And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
" Well please, be my guest.", Come on.
 Oh this is gonna be beautiful.," Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. "
" You know I've seen this before, right?  I still don't know how you do it.", Smell the silent judgment?
 Um-hmm., Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
 Here we go., It's physics.
 Physics!," Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?"
" Yes, of course.", I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.  I'll be right back. 
 Are you even pulling?, Are you on my team?
 Just represent! Pull!," Alright, let's go! "
 Huh?," Let's go, Steve, no pressure."
 Nothing., And?
" Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered."," All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged."
  Did you tell everyone about that?," The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?"
 Stark., JARVIS.
" I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a-dream?","  Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit."
 We are here to help.," One sec, one sec I got this!"
  It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe., Come on! That's the one!
 But there wasn't anyone else in the building., Yes there was.
" Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.","  Come on. Use your words, buddy."
 You think this is funny?," No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible."
 This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.," No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this."
" Tony, maybe this might not be the time to--"," Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls."
 Only when I've created a murder bot., We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
" Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.", Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
" No, it's never come up.", Saved New York?
 Never heard that.," Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?"
 Together., We'll lose.
 Girlfriend. , What's this?
 A message. Ultron killed Strucker.," And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us."
" Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.", Not everything.
" Well, these people are all horrible."," Wait. I know that guy.  From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.  There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab."""
  What's this?," Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it..."
 Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda., If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
 I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?,  The strongest metal on earth.
" What?! I'm not...!  I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is  I'm sorry. I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness!"," Ahh, Junior.  You're gonna break your old man's heart."
 Clearly you've never made an omelet., He beat me by one second.
" Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?", This was never my life.
 I think you're confusing peace with quiet., Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
" Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.", And you're not going anywhere.
" Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner."," News or footage, keyword: Hulk.  Natasha, I could really use a lullaby."
" Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here."," I'm calling in VERONICA.  Alright everybody, stand down!  You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner."
iron man," Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner.  Okay.  In the back? Dick move, Banner.  VERONICA, gimme a hand.  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.  No, not that way, not that way!  Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me!  Everybody out! Going to get ugly!  I'm sorry.  Damage report.  That's comprehensive. Show me something.  How quickly can we buy this building? "
" The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.", Stark Relief Foundation?
 Already on the scene. How's the team?, Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
" Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here."," So, run and hide?"
" Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer."," Neither do we.  Hey, you wanna switch out?"
" No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.", A few hours from where?
 What is this place?, A safe house?
 Hey.,  This is an agent of some kind.
" Hi, sweetheart!  Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...",  These are...smaller agents.
 Sorry for barging in on you.," Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed."
" What, so we disappear?", Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
 Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.," Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him."
" ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.", Seems like you walked away all right.
 Is that a problem?, I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
 Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.," You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?"
 Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question., Banner and I were doing research.
 That would affect the team.," That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?"
"  I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might..."," Yeah, I'll give her a kick.  Don't take from my pile.  Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?"
 Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.," Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?"
 Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.," Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?"
 Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down., You're not the director of me.
" I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you."," And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could."
" The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear."," I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on."
" You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them."," I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part."
" Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.", He still going after launch codes?
" Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.", I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
" He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.", By whom?
" Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is."," I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown."""
 To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.," Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it."
 I'll take Natasha and Clint.," Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can."
 If Ultron is really building a body..., He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
 I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?," She's all yours, apparently."
" The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well."," A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack."
 How do you find it?," Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me."
 Anything on Nat?," Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it."
" We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within."," Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?"
" I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted."," Yeah, about that."
  No., You have to trust me.
 Kinda don't., Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. 
" Hello, Dr. Banner."," Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together."
" So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?"," No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone."
 And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?," JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to."
" No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong."," I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line."
"  I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me…""  ""…just makes me stronger."" ", This framework is not compatible.
 I'm gonna say this once.," How about ""nonce""?"
 Shut it down!," Nope, not gonna happen."
" Banner, after everything that's happened--", That's nothing compared to what's coming!
 What? You didn't see that coming?, I'm rerouting the upload.
" Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?", We... reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
" I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.", What's he waiting for?
" Good evening, boss."," No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor."
 I got no plans tomorrow night., I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
 Come to confess your sins?," I don't know, how much time you got?"
 More than you.," Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy..."
 You're stalling to protect the people.," Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?"
 Alright., FRIDAY! The Vision?
"  You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. ", FRIDAY?
" The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.", If it drops?
" Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction.  That building's not clear, the tenth floor. ", Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! 
" I got airborne, heading up to the bridge."," Cap, you got incoming."
" The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.", The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
" It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating."," Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back."
" The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?"," Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear."
" I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.", Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
 Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story., Yep. If you live to tell it.
 You think I can't hold my own?," We get through this, I'll hold your own."
" Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.", I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
 Running numbers.  A heat seal could work with enough power.," Thor, I got a plan!"
 We're out of time. They're coming for the core.," Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier."
 On it.," Avengers, time to work for a living."
 Yeah.," Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini."""
" Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly.  What's the drill?","  This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose."
" This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?"," Well, like the old man said. Together."
 They'll try to leave the city.," We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!"
" Boss, power levels are way below opt...", Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.
 Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!," Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church."
 Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.," You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away."
 I just did. Do you know how it felt?  It felt like that.," Thor, on my mark.  Now!"
 The rules have changed., We're dealing with something new.
" Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.", A machine.
 So it doesn't count., No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
 Right. Different rules for us.," Nice guy, but artificial."
 But if you put the hammer in an elevator..., It would still go up.
 I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.," Well, not if you don't leave."
 I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position..., Triple Yahtzee?
" I do.  Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. ", That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. 
" I will miss you, Tony."," Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up."
 The simple life., You'll get there one day.
" I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. ", You alright?
" I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could."," That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh."
iron man," It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it."
 Tony.]," Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? ""To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke."
iron man," Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded."
iron man," No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now."
 Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.], Go break some eggs.
" Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, ""Ooh, gross,"" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . ."," Restroom's this way, yeah?"
" Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.", It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
" That was nice, what you did for those young people."," Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience."
 They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?, Are you going up?
 I'm right where I want to be.," Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard."
 It's because he's already made up his mind.," Boy, you know me so well."
iron man," Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache."
iron man," That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?"
iron man," Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia."
iron man," He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. "
iron man," There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys."
" Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.", Who said we're giving up?
" No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change."," That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing."
" Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own."," If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty."
 I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.," Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?"
" Oh, I want to take it back now."," No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win."
 He's alive.,"  No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup."
 Try not to break anything while we fix this.,"  Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir."
 'Consequences'?, Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
 That's cold., Warmer than jail.
 Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)," Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.  FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most."
 Some would say it brought our country closer to war.," See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?"
 Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.," We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . ."
 Pregnant?, No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
" I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know."," A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.  In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work."
" You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single."," Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you."
 I don't mean to make things difficult.," I know, because you're a very polite person."
 If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.," No, you don't."
"  No, I don't. Sometimes . . ."," Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison."
"  I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards."," Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . ."
 Wanda? What about Wanda?," She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company."
" Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .", What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
" Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.", She's not a US citizen.
" Oh, come on, Tony.", And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
 She's a kid!, GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
" Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go."," FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage."
 Please tell me you brought a suit.," Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant."
 I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?, We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
 If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.," All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in."
 How would that end any differently from the last time?," Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed."
 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.," Thank you, sir.  My left arm is numb, is that normal?"
  You alright?," Always.  36 hours, jeez."
 We're seriously understaffed.," Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?"
 No. You really think he'd be on our side?, No.
 I have an idea., Me too. Where's yours?
 Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . ," Oh, Mr. Parker."
" Um . . .  What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.", Tony.
 What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?," It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?"
 Yeah. Yeah., Right?
 About the grant., The September Foundation.
 Right., Yeah. Remember when you applied?
 Yeah.," I approved, so now we're in business."
" Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?", That's what I'm here to hash out.
" Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.", It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
" Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?", This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
 Let me just stop you there., Yeah?
" Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?", Yeah.
 Yeah?, It's pretty well funded.
 Wow., Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
 Sure.,"  As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.  Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?"
" Uh, the garbage, actually.", You're a dumpster diver.
" Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.", Ah-ah! Me first.
 Okay.," Quick question of the rhetorical variety.  That's you, right?"
" Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?"," Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills."
" That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.", Mm-Hmm.
 It's like that video. What is it?," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?"
 Exactly.," Oh, what have we here?"
  Uh . . . that's a . . ., So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
  S . . . Spider-Man.," Not in that onesie, you're not."
" It's not a onesie.  I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!", Who else knows? Anybody?
 Nobody., Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
" No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.", You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
 I did.," Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?"
 It's a long story. I was uh . . ., Lordy! Can you even see in these?
" Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus."," You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.  Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?"
" Because . . .  because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.", Mm-Hmm.
" I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now."," Sure, because you're different."
" Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . .  and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.","  So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?"
 Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.,"  I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.  You got a passport?"
" Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.", You ever been to Germany?
 No.," Oh, you'll love it."
 I can't go to Germany!, Why?
 I got . . . homework., I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
 I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!, Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
  Don't tell Aunt May.," Alright, Spider-Man.  Get me out of this."
 Suit up.," Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?"
 Your highness.," Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?"
 You're after the wrong guy., Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
 Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?," All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!  Nice job, kid."
" Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you."," Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation."
" Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man."," Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . ."
" Hey, everyone.", . . . Good job.
 You've been busy.," And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart."
 You did that when you signed.," Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite.  Come on."
"  I believe this is yours, Captain America."," Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?"
" Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?", What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
" Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. ","  Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings."
 You locked me in my room.," Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint."
" Hey, man."," Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?"
" Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. ", First time for everything.
 Multiple contusions detected.," Yeah, I detected that too."
"  Is this, part of the plan?"," Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?"
 They're not stopping., Neither are we. 
 Brooklyn. ,  Friday?
 We have some weapon systems offline., They what?
" Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.", Who's speaking?
 It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days., Friday?
" Way to go, Tic Tac!", Give me back my Rhodey. 
 I got him! ," Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion."
" Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?"," I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side."
  You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? , Maybe the kid's on to something.
 Does anyone have any orange slices?,"  Kid, you alright?"
 Hey! Get off me!, Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
" Oh. Hey, man.", Yeah.
 That was scary., Yeah. You're done. Alright?
 What?, You did a good job. Stay down.
" No, I'm good. I'm fine.", Stay down.
" No, it's good I gotta get him back!", You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
" Vision, I got a bandit on my six.  Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.", Rhodey! 
" Tony, I'm flying dead stick. ", RHODES!  Read vitals.
 I know. But I did it., How did this happen?
 I became distracted., I didn't think that was possible.
 Neither did I. , The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
" Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario."," You let them go, Nat."
 We played this wrong.," 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA."
 Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?," T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you."
 I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. ,"  What am I looking at, Friday?"
 Priority upload from Berlin police., Fire up the chopper.
 The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man., Did you run facial recognition yet?
 What do I look like?," Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head."
 You must be thinking of someone else., Must be.
" The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence.  Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad."," So, what happened to the real Broussard?"
 He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes., Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
"  This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark."," So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy."
"  The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not."," Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on."
"  Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony."," Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . ."
" Criminals?  Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for.  Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.", Because you broke the law.
 Yeah., I didn't make you.
" La, la, la, la, la . . ."," You read it, you broke it."
" La, la, la, la la…"," Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? "
" Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.", Who are you?
 How's Rhodes?, They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
  You're the good cop now?, I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
" Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me."," Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment."
  What did you do? Get it back up!,"  Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong."
 That's a first., Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
" Hey, it's alright.  Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.", Easy.
 Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?," Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. "
 Yeah., You seem a little defensive.
 It's been a long day.," At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you."
 Then why are you here?," Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself."
" Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.  It's good to see you, Tony."," You too, Cap.  Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . "
iron man, I got heat signatures.
 How many?," Uh, one."
" I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.", I'm betting I could beat that.
  I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.,  I know that road. What is this?
 Tony. Tony.,  Did you know?
 I didn't know it was him.," Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?"
" It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!", Move!
 Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised., Ah crap.
 He's not going to stop. Go.," Come on, come on."
" Targeting system's knackered, boss.", I'm eyeballing it.  Do you even remember them?
 This isn't gonna change what happened., I don't care. He killed my mom.
 You can't beat him hand to hand., Analyse his fight pattern.
 Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.,  Let's kick his ass. 
 He's my friend., So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.
  I can do this all day., That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! 
  Did it?, It's just the first pass.
 Yeah., Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
 You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . , Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
" No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. ", You okay?
 Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.," Yeah, put him through."
" Tony, we have a problem."," Ah, please hold."
" (whispers) Okay, there’s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who’s that new guy?", Underoos!
 We have thin walls here.," What are you doing, a little video diary?"
 (embarrassed) Yeah., It’s all right. I’d probably do the same.
 (from the driver’s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything., It’s okay.
 I’m gonna wipe the chip.," Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?"
" Yeah, hold on.", We rolling?
 An alibi? Sure., Get in the frame.
 Okay.," Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope."
iron man," Peter, that’s inappropriate. All right, let’s start over. You can edit it."
 Mm-hmm.," Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed."
 Come on! It’s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I’m sorry.," This is because you’re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver."
 That was a private conversation. I don’t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.," No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?"
 All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.," Happy, can you give us a moment?"
 You want me to leave the car?, Why don’t you grab Peter’s case out of the trunk.
 I can keep the suit?," Yes, we were just talking about it."
iron man," Do me a favor, though. Happy’s kind of your point guy on this. Don’t stress him out. Don’t do anything stupid. I’ve seen his cardiogram. All right?"
 (enthusiastically) Yes.," Don’t do anything I would do, and definitely don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. There’s a... There’s a little grey area in there, and that’s where you operate."
" Wait, does that mean that I’m an Avenger?", No.
 This it?, Seventh floor.
" So when’s, when’s our next... When’s our next “retreat,” you know? Like..."," What, next mission?"
" Yeah, the mission. The missions.", We’ll call you.
 Do you have my numbers?," No, I mean, we’ll call you. Like, someone will call you."
 Oh., All right?
 From your team., Okay.
iron man, It’s not a hug. I’m just grabbing the door for you. We’re not there yet.
], Bye.
" And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How’d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?", I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.
" Whew, that’s better. Thanks.", What were you thinking?
 The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.," Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing."
 The Avengers?," No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade."
" Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn’t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine."," Oh, I’m not here."
iron man, Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you’re at it.
iron man, Cheers.
iron man," Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please."
 Why?, Why? Because I said so!
iron man," Sorry, I’m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can’t you just be a friendly..."
iron man, ...neighborhood Spider-Man?
 But I’m ready for more than that now.," No, you are not."
 That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.," Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would’ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy."
 Are you driving?," You know, it’s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call."
" No, no, no. No, no, don’t answer.", Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
" No, you’re not.", Nice work in D.C.
 Okay., My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I’m just trying to break the cycle of shame.
" Uh, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now."," Don’t cut me off when I’m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-"
iron man, What is that?
" Uh, I’m at band practice.", That’s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What’s up?
" I gotta go. Uh, end call.", Hey.
 What the hell...," Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?"
" Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?", I think you’ve done enough.
 (to Schultz) You in?," Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do."
 Is everyone okay?, No thanks to you.
" Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn’t listen. None of this would’ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you’d actually be here."," I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid."
 I’m fifteen.," No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? ‘Cause that’s on you. And if you died, I feel like that’s on me. I don’t need that on my conscience."
" Yes, sir.", Yes.
" I, I’m sorry.", Sorry doesn’t cut it.
 I understand. I just wanted to be like you.," And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it’s not working out. I’m gonna need the suit back."
 For how long?, Forever.
iron man," Yeah. Yeah, that’s how it works."
" No, no, no... Please, please, please...", Let’s have it.
 You don’t understand. Please. This is all I have. I’m nothing without this suit.," If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad."
 I don’t have any other clothes.," Okay, we’ll sort that out."
" Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I’m down here. I’m down here. I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I can’t move. I can’t..."," If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it."
 You don’t see that every day.," Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?"
 Good., Give me a minute with the kid.
 Seriously?, Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.
 I’ll be close behind., How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.
iron man," Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn’t you think? Don’t you think?"
" Yeah, yeah, I guess.", Let’s just say it was.
" Mr. Stark, I really-"," You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team."
 To the... To the team?," Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There’s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers."
iron man, When you’re ready... Why don’t you try that on? And I’ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.
 I..., Yeah. Give that a look.
iron man," So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where’s he between? He’s next to Vision?"
" Yeah, Vision’s not big on doors.", It’s fun.
 Or walls., (to Peter) You’ll fit right in.
" Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I’m good.", You’re good? Good? How are you good?
" Well, I mean, I’m... I’d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody’s got to look out for the little guy, right?"," You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?"
 No.," Okay. It’s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?"
" Thank you, Mr. Stark."," Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well."
 See you around., Okay.
" That was a test, right? There’s, uh, nobody back there?"," Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck."
" Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you."," Yeah, thank you."
 Everybody’s waiting., You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.
 Did you guys screw this up?, (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.
 Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?," Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?"
" Do I... I, uh...", The engagement ring?
], Okay.
 I think I can think of something better than that.," Well, it would buy us a little time."
iron man, Like we need time.
 I can’t believe you have that thing in your pocket.," Want me to get the door for you, hon?"
 Avengers: Infinity War)," Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding. Pepper Potts:  You're totally rambling."
iron man," No, I'm not."
 Lost me.," Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?"
 Yeah.," Okay, and then you're like, “Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?” “Oh! Someone's watching.” “I'm gonna go in my pants.”"
" Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.", Yes.
 Yeah. Everybody has that.," Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"
  Right., Morgan! Morgan.
" So you woke up, and thought that we were...", Expecting.
 Yeah.,  Yes?
 Shaking her head} No., I had a dream about it. It was so real.
" If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that."," I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles."
" It's not helping your case, OK?"," No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-"
 {Insistently] You don't need that.," I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future, us, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know..."
 Shirts?, You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
 You should have shirts in your closet., Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Winston. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
 Yes., I will. (Tony kisses Pepper.)
" Tony, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way."," I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?"
" We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.", And who's “we”?
"  Hey, Tony.",  Bruce.
 Hi., You okay?
" Tell me his name again. Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets, he takes what he wants, he wipes out half the population. He sent Loki! The attack on New York, that's him! Tony:  This is him...What's our timeline? Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe! If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony... Doctor Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of.",  Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?
 Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?, Is that what this is...?
iron man,"  I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?"
 We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.," And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so..."
 Stark Raving Hazelnuts., It's not bad.
 That's a thing?, Whatever. Point is: Things change.
 Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.," And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us."
" Well, if we don't do our jobs."," What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?"
" Okay, guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is that we have the Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.","  Yeah, that's the thing."
 What do you mean?," Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline."
" What?! Tony, you lost another super bot?!", I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
" Who could find Vision, then?", Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
"  Oh, great.", Maybe. But...
  Call him.," It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?"
 No., The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
 Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?, Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
" Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."," Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?"
"  ... Not at the moment, no. ", You okay?
iron man," Help him! Wong, Doc."
 Go! Got it!,"  F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?"
iron man," Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!"
 What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?," F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
" Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..."," I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
 Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you're trespassing in this city and on this planet., It means get lost Squidward!
 He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone.," Banner, you want a piece?"
" No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?", That's right.
iron man," Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
" I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.", Where's your guy?
 I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing., There's no time for a thing.
 I know., That's the thing right there. Let's go.
iron man," {Glances at Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
" Tony, I'm sorry. (STAMMERS) Either I can't or he won't-"," It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
 Where'd that come from?, It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
" Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..."," Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
 It stays with me., Exactly. Bye.
" Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?"," Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?"
 I'm trying. He won't come out., Hammer. 
" Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?"," Kid, where'd you come from?"
" What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?", He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
 You'll only wish you were dead. Strange falls unconscious and is Maw moves to grab him. The Cloak of Levitation flies Strange away} No!,"  Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it."
 Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.," Hang on, kid.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y.  Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you."
 But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!, You're too high up. You're running out of air.
" Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!"," Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
" Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?"," Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
 Why?,  Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for awhile.
 Tell me you're not on that ship., Yeah.
" God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship."," Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
" Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...", Pep...
" Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...", What the-
 I know what you're gonna say., You should not be here.
 I was gonna go home-, I don't wanna hear it.
 But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-, And now I gotta hear it.
" ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.", (seriously) What did you just say?
 I take that back. And now I'm here in space., Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
 No. I did think this through., You could not have possibly thought this through.
" It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider – Man when there's no neighborhood. (Pause) Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.", Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
 ...could end your friend's life in an instant.," I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
 You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.," Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies."
 We've gotta turn this ship around., Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
" No, I want to protect the stone.", And I want you to thank me. Go ahead. I'm listening.
 For what? Nearly blasting me into space?, Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
 I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet., Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
" Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you."," And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
 I'm backup., No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
" Oh we're using our made-up names. Um...I'm Spider-Man, then.", This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
 Can we control it? Fly us home? (Tony doesn't make eye contact.) Stark?, Yeah.
 Can you get us home?, Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
 Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.," No. It's you who doesn't understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years...Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?"
" (a pause) Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand...if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it."," Good. Nice. Moral compass.We're straight. (Turning to Peter, he puts his outstretched arm briefly on either shoulder) Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now."
" (To Tony) Hey, what's going on?", I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function. (Instructing Peter to put his arm in the machine for piloting) Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
" Yep, got it."," This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
 Okay. Okay. Ready., We might wanna turn.
 Turn! Turn! Turn!, (To Strange) You alright?
iron man, That was close. I owe you one.
" Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...And I end up eating you, I'm sorry.", (While pointing at Peter) I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
 Everybody stay where you are. Chill F out. (Quill powers off his helmet) I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?," Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?"
" Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak."," Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! (Tony extends his nanotech gun)"
 What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? “Jesus”?, You're from Earth?
 I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.," Yeah, that's on Earth dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?"
 You're the ones Thor told us about., You know Thor?
" Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving.", Where is he now?
 The *heck* happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.," Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just need the gauntlet."
iron man," Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?"
" I stopped listening after you said, “We need a plan.”"," (To Quill) Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page."
" (Quietly as he shifts to a commanding position beside Mantis) Yeah, that's right"," (Tony stands for a moment with an expression of hopelessness) Alright, just get over her, please. Mr. Lord can you get your folks to circle up?"
 “Mr. Lord.” Star-Lord is fine. (Motions to Drax and Mantis), We gotta coalesce. ‘Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude..”
 Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe., What dance-off?
 It never was.," Don't encourage this, alright?"
 Okay., We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
" Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. (Quill points at Stark and Parker) So that 50% of me that's stupid... That's 100% you.", Your math is blowing my mind.
" Excuse me, but...Does your friend often do that?"," Strange, we alright?"
iron man, You're back. You're alright. Hi.
" 14,000,605.", How many did we win?
" Yeah, if your goal is to piss him off!", So this is it. It's all been leading to this.
  Quill...?," Steady, Quill."
  Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...,  You're all right.
 Wrra! ," You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position.  Oh yeah, that was close.  That's a goal. We're now one apiece."
 I would like to try again. , We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
iron man, That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. 
iron man, And... you've won. Congratulations. 
iron man, Fair game. Good sport.  Have fun?
 It was fun.," This thing on?  Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22.  You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there.  You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time.  But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you."
iron man, Couldn't stop him.
 Neither could I., I lost the kid.
" Tony, we lost."," Is, uh...? "
" Oh, my God! Oh, my God! ", It's okay.
" World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.", Where is he now? Where?
 We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through., What's wrong with him?
" Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?"," Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear."
" We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him."," Who told you that?  I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight."
 Okay., He's unbeatable.
" Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?", Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
" Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.",  And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need?  I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -
" Tony, Tony, Tony!", Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
" Well, that didn't work out, did it?"," I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers."
 Okay., Right?
 You made your point. Just sit down., Okay...
 Okay?," Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?"
" Tony, you're sick.","  She's great, by the way."
 Sit down. Sit.," We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!  I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar."
iron man," Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide."
 Tony!, I'm fine. I...
 Define lunch or be disintegrated. ," Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)"
 Okay., There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
 No., That's what you want. How did you find this?
 Garage., Really? Were you looking for it?
" No. I found it, though."," You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her."
" Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?"," Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?"
 (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.," In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home."
 I did.," No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?"
 (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?," Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?"
 We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.," Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?"
 I don't believe we would.," Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise."
" Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -"," I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?"
  No., Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
 Tony... We have to take a stand.," We did stand. And yet, here we are."
" I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.  And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even..."," That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid."
 Mommy told me to come and save you.," Good job. I'm saved.  I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six."
" Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too."," Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please."
 Processing...," Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second."
 Just a moment., And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
 Model rendered., Shit!
 Shit.,"  What are you doing up, little mess?"
 Shit.," No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her."
 Why you up?," 'Cause I got some important shit going on here.  What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind."
 Was it Juice Pops?," Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on...  my mind."
iron man," You done? Yeah, now you are.  That face goes there."
 Tell me a story.," A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end."
  That's a horrible story.," Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. "
 I love you 3000.,"  Wow.  3000. That's crazy.  Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night."
iron man," Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. "
iron man,  What are you reading?
" Oh, it's just a book on composting.",  What's new with composting?
 Just -," I figured it out, by the way."
" You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -", Time travel.
"  What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.", That's right.
 We got really lucky.," Yeah, I know."
 A lot of people didn't.," No, I can't help everybody."
 It sort a seems like you can.," Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop."
" Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life. ", I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
 What? I..I see this as an absolute win!, Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
" Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?","  That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it."
 You did.," Oh, did I?  Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it.  A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace.  Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it."
 Me too.," We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice."
 Tony...," Why? He made it for you.  Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
" Thank you, Tony."," Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?"
 I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.,"  Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski.  Ratchet, How's it going?"
" Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.", Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
" Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history."," Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in."
 Which means we have to pick our targets., Correct.
" Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves...  Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane,  Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead,  and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever,  I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.", Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
" Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?", Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
" Nice place in the village, though.", Yeah. Sullivan Street.
" Wait, he lived in New York?", No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?
 Right? ," All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green."
 And you? Where are you right now?," Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. "
 Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.," Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit  did nothing for your ass."
" No one asked you to look, Tony.",  It's ridiculous.
 Who are these guys?," They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet."
" Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys."," You're small, but you're talking loud."
iron man," All right, you're up, little buddy.  There's our stone."
  Alright. Flick me.," All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor."
 On it. Head to the lobby., Alright. I'll see you there.
 That's okay. Trust me.  Hail Hydra.," Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time."
 Bombs away.  Is... is that Axe body spray?," Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?"
" Hand over the case, Stark.","  All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go."
 You promise me you won't die?, You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
 That doesn't sound mild.," Do it, Lang!"
iron man, Window's closing. Pull my pin!
 Here goes!," MEDIC! You guys, some help!"
iron man, Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
" That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?"," Oh, we blew it."
" No! He knows!  Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows.", Cap–
iron man," Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem."
" Well, what are we gonna do now?"," You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk."
 You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–," You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself."
 You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.," Dude, come on."
" You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–", I dropped the ball.
 You ruined the time heist., Is that what I did?
" Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either."," I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State."
 When were they both there?, They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
 What are you talking about? Where are we going?, I know for a fact they were there–
 Who's they? What are we doing?, And I know how I know.
" Guys, what's up? What is it?"," Well, it looks like we're improvising."
 Right. What are we improvising?," Scott, get this back to the compound."
iron man, Suit up.
 What's in New Jersey?," 0-4,"
 0-4– -," Uhh, 0-7."
 Excuse me..., 1-9-7-0.
" Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back."," Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.  Do you trust me?"
 I do., Your call.
 Here we go.," Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?"
 The idea of me was.," Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?"
 In plain sight.,"  Good luck on your mission, Captain."
 Not exactly.,  Gotcha. Back in the game.
" Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal."," Oh, yeah."
 I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?," Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul.  Pardon me."
 Do I know you?," No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT."
 Huh. MIT. Got a name?, Uh– Howard.
" Well, that'll be easy to remember.", Howard– Potts.
" Well, I'm Howard Stark. ", Hi. 
" Shake it, don't pull it.", Yeah–
" You look a little green around the gills there, Potts."," I'm fine. Just, long hours."
" Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts.", Yeah. That would be swell.
 That way., Okay.
 Excuse me! Out of the way!," So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?"
" My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too much time in the office.", Congratulations.
" Thanks. Hold this, will you?"," Yeah, sure. How far along is she?"
 I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again., I have a little girl.
 A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me., What'd be so awful about that?
" Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach."," So, where are you at with names?"
" Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo."," Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time."
 Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?, Wildly. Yeah.
 Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?," I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–"
" My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt."," I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl."
 Yeah? Like what?," ""No amount of money ever bought a second of time."""
 Smart guy., He did his best.
" Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts."," Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country."
" Clint, where's Nat?", Do we know if she had family?
 (confused) What?, I just asked him a question–
" No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.", It's not about that–
 Lightning., Yeah.
 We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma.  It's like...I was made for this.," Good to go, yeah?"
 Let's do it.," You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years."
 Got it.," F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?"
" No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?"," Talk to me, Banner."
 Bruce!, Don't move him.
" But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters."," Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man.  You lose this again, I'm keeping it."
 What happened?, You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.
iron man, What's he been doing?
 Where are the stones?, Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
" You know it's a trap, right?", Yeah. And I don't much care.
 Good. Just as long we are all in agreement.  Let's kill him properly this time., Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
 You can change.," Okay, Thor. Hit me."
 No! We need to get them back where they came from., No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
 Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!," Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?"
" We're on it, Cap."," Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it."
" If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.", You better be right.
 What the hell is this?," F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?"
" Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]", And I– am– Iron Man.
 Hey.,"  Hey, Pep.."
